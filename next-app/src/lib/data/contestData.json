            "statement": "When King County voters elected me, I promised to be an “activist Assessor.” I have been. We have fought to protect senior homeowners from soaring values, make it easier to get your refund, and see how much that ballot measure is going to cost. But more should be done. That’s why I am asking for your vote again. I’ll fight for a truly fair and equitable property tax system. We’re in a housing crisis. Housing affordability threatens everyone – whether homeowners, seniors, renters or small business owners. Our homeless crisis leaves women and children to sleep out on the street because there is no room in the shelter. An “activist” Assessor can help. We’ve gone twice to Olympia to reform the senior and disabled property tax relief program. Now thousands of our neighbors can stay in their homes. Responding to our homelessness crisis, we found surplus public and vacant private property, which can be used for housing solutions. We have identified the land. We should put it to use. The housing shortage makes homes and apartments in King County so expensive. Smarter density can bring us more housing at a more affordable price. But our property tax system was never designed to handle annual assessed value increases of up to just over 50%. And while actual taxes, including those voter approved, are considerably less, in these inflationary times it literally hits home. I’ve been a tireless taxpayer champion. Homeowners, renters, and small businesses deserve a tax break. I'm working with Assessors statewide to save everyday people real money without gutting vital local services. I am proud to be endorsed by Democrats and Republicans, labor and business, and folks in Seattle and the suburbs. While much has been done, we must do more. I ask for your vote.",

I catch glimpses of myself learning how to ride a bike at New Holly, playing high school basketball for Franklin, and renting movies with my family at the old Hollywood Video. When I take that drive these days, I see all the opportunities and challenges before us in District 2. The skyrocketing cost of living is forcing people to work double shifts to pay for half the groceries. The lack of affordable homes has pushed our neighbors to live on street corners. Staffing shortages have led countless people to live in crisis without the immediate attention of first responders. In my first four years on the Council, my team and I have led major efforts to address these problems. My office formulated and passed one of the largest investments in mental health and addiction recovery in our state’s history with the Crisis Care Centers initiative. My office uplifted Skyway, leading to unprecedented investment in this neighborhood’s housing, transit, and community infrastructure. My office championed the building of thousands of homes across King County by co-sponsoring Health through Housing, home ownership initiatives, Tiny House villages, the Youth Achievement Center, and more. My office passed historic tenant protections to keep people in their homes in the wake of a global pandemic. My office created new gun violence prevention strategies to reduce the shootings in key areas around the district. These are just a fraction of our efforts but much more is needed. I am running for a second term on the King County Council to continue the work of keeping our communities safe, housed, and healthy.

As your Councilmember, I will focus on proven, commonsense solutions on crime, homelessness, and public health. As an immigrant child from the Philippines who grew up in south Seattle, I've seen firsthand our community’s biggest challenges. I was fortunate to have access to quality healthcare, thanks to my mom's union. Inspired by her, I chose nursing as my profession, serving a diverse community, including those experiencing homelessness and addiction. As Mayor, I take action to prevent and address drug deaths: the fastest rising numbers in the nation. On County Council, I will focus on housing and treatment services. I will push for increased accountability from our troubled Regional Homelessness Authority. Countywide, communities are struggling with crime. This is especially true for our most economically vulnerable neighborhoods. When people call 911, they deserve a fast, effective response. I am the only candidate in this race who has consistently opposed defunding the police. As Mayor, I worked to increase law enforcement staffing. On King County Council, I will deliver both commonsense reforms and more first responders. King County has a lot to be optimistic about.

We saw chaos in supply chain logistics and travel through the airport came to a screeching halt.  I’m proud that despite COVID-19, the port weathered the pandemic without laying off a single port employee and saved every small and minority dining and retail tenant at the airport from going out of business. We were able to do this because we made principled decisions that put people first. Despite the pandemic, we were able to invest in the airport to get upgraded from 3 to 4-stars by Skytrax and we won “Best Airport in North America” in 2022 and 2023. We were also the only port on the west coast to add container terminal space during the pandemic. I have worked tirelessly to ensure the growth and economic prosperity of King County, promote sustainability, and combat human trafficking. I’m asking for 4 more years because the job’s not finished. In a post-pandemic world, we must build the “port of the future.” A future where we create the next generation of strong family wage jobs; A future where we are the greenest port in North America; A future where we usher in new technologies such as hydrogen and offshore wind. With your support, we can build a port of the future that we can all be proud of.  Endorsed by over 50 local elected leaders, Seattle Building Trades, ILWU, Washington Conservation Action, King County Democrats and many others.",

I’m running for a third term to continue my environmental leadership advancing a just and inclusive transition to a clean energy economy that generates living wage careers.          My public service is guided by a triple bottom line: commerce, community, and climate.  I’m committed to expanding environmental and economic justice, especially for near-port communities and small, minority owned businesses.  My experience is needed to exercise policy direction over a fast-growing airport, homeport for Alaska cruise ships and fishing fleet, marinas, parks, and marine cargo Alliance with the Port of Tacoma.         The Port generates 121,000 jobs.  The airport and seaport have won customer service awards even during major construction.  But Port activities also impact communities and the climate. That’s why I’m leading initiatives to electrify seaport and airport operations and transition to alternative fuels for trucks, ships, and planes.  I’m also working to protect parks, advance bicycle safety and Duwamish River cleanup.         I’ll continue reducing the Port’s carbon footprint by directing significant state and federal funding for clean energy projects; Inspiring youth to pursue Port-related careers through apprenticeships and internships; and expanding partnerships with Tribes and the Seattle Aquarium for projects from kelp to killer whales and ecotourism. With your support, I’ll continue to champion Port policies rooted in fiscal responsibility, ecological integrity, and social equity.  I respectfully ask for your vote.         Endorsed By: Seattle Times, The Stranger, MLK Labor Council, Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell, Governor Inslee, Attorney General Ferguson, King County Executive Constantine, County Councilmembers Balducci, Zahilay, Upthegrove, McDermott, Kohl-Welles, Dembowski, Seattle Port Commissioners Mohamed, Hasegawa and Cho, Senators Saldana and Keiser, Sierra Club, King County Democrats and Republicans, Puget Sound Pilots, Pacific Maritime Shipping Association, Planned Parenthood.",

Since 1911, it has promoted economic opportunities and quality of life by advancing trade, commerce, travel, and job creation in an accountable and responsible manner. As a resident of King County for four decades, I’ve experienced the port’s impacts. The port has failed us; environmental issues are hurting low-income communities in South County and it’s time to set a new course with integrity.   We have shared goals: A thriving economy, a cleaner environment, increased family-wage jobs, and a fair and equitable society. We must stop the path of mismanagement. With my extensive career in banking, finance, and real estate, I am ready to steer the port in the right direction as a steward of your hard-earned money.  As an immigrant who arrived with $300, I’ve worked my way up from the mailroom to the boardroom, I’ve founded two Washington state community banks to create jobs for small, women- and minority-owned businesses. I am a staunch promoter of fiscal responsibility with accountability, working closely with stakeholders, labor unions, industry, and trade partners to regain trust in our port. I will promote transitioning from fossil fuels to sustainable green energy.   If elected, I will bring engaging management and open financial positions with transparency to our port community. This will enable us to focus on our dual mission: Generating family-wage jobs and safeguarding our environment. Vote for a stronger, cleaner, and trusted Seattle Port.   Endorsements: ATU Local 587, former WA State Governor Gary Locke, King County Assessor John Wilson, Bellevue Mayor Lynne Robinson, Sen.

Access will be limited to those within walking distance of Bellevue T/C and East Main station. Riders will be required to transfer from light rail to and from buses at the South Bellevue P&R for the commute into and out of Seattle. In 2025 ST’s East Link debut will end ST550 and force all I-90 bus riders transfer to light rail on Mercer Island for the commute into and out of Seattle. It’s the “eastside” version of the ST plan to use “voter approved” extensions to replace buses into Seattle; reducing transit capacity into the city and nothing to reduce congestion. ST will use eastside taxes to help fund a 2nd tunnel rather than use the existing DSTT for those wanting to go beyond CID. The tunnel ends easy access to SeaTac and beyond, spending more than $12B and 6-10 years disrupting Seattle. Part of the reason why the $54B ST3 funding voters approved in 2016 has grown to $160B and continues to grow.",

Expand affordable housing options so working families and young people can call Bellevue home, and seniors can age in their communities.  I am proud to be endorsed by: Bellevue Police and Firefighters; Mayor Lynne Robinson; Deputy Mayor Nieuwenhuis, Bellevue Councilmembers Robertson, Stokes, Lee and Zahn; County Executive Dow Constantine; County Councilmembers Claudia Balducci, Reagan Dunn; State Senators Patty Kuderer, Lisa Wellman; State Representatives Walen, Senn, Slatter and Thai; construction trade unions, and many more!     I’m committed to working with you to create a Bellevue we can all be proud to call home!",

Instead, we increased the number of officers. Rather than going along with the crime-tolerant attitude of the state and county, we acted to discourage the public use of drugs, sleeping on sidewalks, and stealing shopping carts. We continually work on cleaning up and discouraging homeless encampments. At the same time, we refer those impacted by addiction and mental illness to appropriate services. The soon-to-open light rail brings challenges and opportunities to Federal Way. I am actively working to encourage businesses and healthy market-rate housing to locate here. We are turning the ship, but still have far to go. I look forward to continuing to serve you as together we help Federal Way be a wonderful place to work, live, raise families and retire. I appreciate your vote.",

As a teacher for 24 years and an experienced forest firefighter, I understand the role local government plays in supporting education, the safety of our students, emergency services and community preparedness. On the Council, I consistently voted to protect our community from haphazard development which would fundamentally alter life in Sammamish. I believe we can balance healthy growth while maintaining excellent schools, our quality of life and the unique natural beauty of Sammamish. Sometimes it’s hard to distinguish between candidates. My record of support for the environment and responsible development sets me apart. I represent the values of the residents of Sammamish.

As a dedicated employee and mom, I wanted Amazon to do better, and wanted to show my kids the importance of doing what’s right. I put my career on the line and led thousands of my coworkers to take an unprecedented stand. I outlined a plan to win, did the work, and delivered results. Our actions led to Amazon’s Climate Pledge, Bezos’s $10 billion Earth Fund, and increased worker safety. Now I want to help Seattle rise to the challenges of our times. We must make rapid and meaningful progress on safety, homelessness, affordability, and climate change. There are more unsheltered people on our streets than ever. Immediately, we need to increase stable permanent housing and coordinate with regional partners to ensure that those experiencing homelessness have paths to necessary resources. We need to feel safe in our neighborhoods and parks. We can have police and alternative responses; lead with compassion and refuse to tolerate harmful behavior; and tackle poverty, mental illness, and addiction so that crime decreases. I will be a strong advocate for bringing response times down, while ending racial bias and excessive force. Climate change is here and our city isn’t ready. With new federal funding, I will help lead our city to reduce emissions and protect residents from heatwaves, smoke, and flooding. My vision for Seattle is to establish holistic public safety, end homelessness, and lead the nation into the new green economy. Together we can build a safe, equitable, sustainable city for all.

I am a public school dad of three, attorney, community safety advocate, Air Force Veteran, and the proud son of a Nigerian immigrant and former warehouse worker who rescued me from foster care and raised me as a single father.  I believe in safe communities and better policing. Everyone has a right to feel safe in their neighborhood, free of crime or unequal justice. We must enact Both effective prevention strategies And appropriate response capabilities to meet the realities of today’s public safety challenges. While growing up, I lived in public and low-income housing. These experiences taught me that everyone deserves safe, quality affordable housing in a thriving community. A severe lack of housing for people at all income levels means that those at the bottom are suffering the most. We must build more affordable housing, particularly low-income housing and workforce housing for middle income residents. As a former foster kid, I know what it’s like to be completely uprooted and swept away. We must do better for our unhoused neighbors. Sadly, the homelessness crisis in our city has devolved into a total humanitarian catastrophe. It is our moral imperative to take urgent action and find people housing and treatment now.  At City Hall, I’ll normalize collaborating across differences, finding common ground, and getting bold things accomplished that work for everyone. I know there is a better way forward for Seattle, and I couldn’t be more energized at the opportunity we have to do it together!  Endorsed by The Seattle Times, 34th District Democrats, King County Councilmember Girmay Zahilay, State Representative Chipalo Street, former 34th Rep.

I’ve got the experience to organize community-centered approaches and I secure the investments to match. I deliver on progressive values rather than simply profess them. My office has a proven track record of taking action. I committed to investing in historically under-funded schools, so I funded mental health and leadership programs in Southend schools. I said I would prevent displacement, so we won tenant protections, monumental worker protections—like paid sick leave for gig workers—and rent control for small businesses. I secured permanent funding for community-driven development, and for the Green New Deal. I envision housing abundance, affordability, and vibrant small businesses within reach of all generations who stay rooted in their community. Children with full stomachs and single mothers with full wallets. Community networks preventing violence rather than only reacting to it. I’ve only just begun building alternatives to punishment and incarceration—especially for our Black and brown neighbors, who suffer from the paradox of over-policing and under-policing. We all deserve to feel safe in our neighborhoods. As a mom with two kids in Seattle Public Schools, it’s important that all our children feel safe, protected, and cared for. We’ve only begun that work by investing in the resources District 2 needs to improve our community health, joy, and safety. Thank you for electing me to serve D2’s vibrant communities. I hope to earn your vote for re-election. Proudly endorsed by The Stranger, MLK Labor, King County Dems, Progreso Latino, Rep.

I want to change that. As a community advocate and proven leader I have fought against continued discrimination from the city towards one of the most endangered neighborhoods in America, and I’ve seen that fighting for our voice and community based solutions is a fight we can win. I'll bring that same passion to fight for all of south Seattle. We can have better public safety. Every week, my watch group works side by side with community and unhoused neighbors providing mutual aid and helping connect people to essential services. I have administered Narcan, CPR and fought for our most vulnerable, marginalized communities. We need a balanced approach that invests in community programs and works in collaboration with city agencies.  We can have more affordable housing while fighting displacement and gentrification. My family renovated the historic Louisa Hotel into workforce housing which only charges residents a percentage of their income so nobody is charged rent they cannot afford. I have the experience to build more homes and social housing.  Our community is tired of elected officials always responding with words and good intentions that yield no results. Things aren’t getting better, it’s time for a change. We need leaders who are not afraid of the streets of South Seattle, who will be there for our community when it’s hard, to listen and make a real difference.

I’ve already created positive changes in housing and transit, reforming enforcement and improving neighborhoods. I led First Hill’s neighborhood association, where we welcomed affordable housing, safer transportation, improved parks, and increased livability.

PubliCola added, “Hudson is the most qualified candidate for any of this year’s open seats, blowing the rest of the field away…” I offer substantive, constructive solutions to complicated problems like homelessness, public safety, and affordability. We can build more housing, care for vulnerable neighbors, and keep everyone safe. I understand how to make progress on our challenges.

Instead, I’ve got a serious plan to build the ambitious future we deserve. I didn’t start life in a place like Roosevelt. I’m the product of a teen pregnancy, but my parents managed to buy a house and build us a beautiful life. I got really lucky, graduated from Harvard Law School, launched a tech company, and have been a business leader since. Journeys like mine are impossible in Seattle today. Seattle should be a place where people from any background can afford to raise a family, build a career, and age comfortably–and where no one lives on the street. Where it is as easy to get around without a car as it is with one, and where tomorrow’s workforce has housing and childcare they can afford in tree-lined neighborhoods they love. This means we have to fix our finances–from tens of millions in waste, to using revenue sources that don’t take from young families or seniors on fixed incomes. We can’t let the big-money PACs trying to buy this election cut their taxes and keep leaving the rest of us with the tab.  As a parent, I will always put results ahead of political theatrics when it comes to safety. Let’s stop crime before it starts with evidence-based prevention, quickly send the right professional for each emergency, and rebuild trust in law enforcement through good governance and accountability. I’m proud to be endorsed by the MLK labor council, the local Democrats, the Sierra Club, and political leaders like Darya Farivar, Nicole Macri, Hilary Franz, Toshiko Haswegawa, Ryan Calkins, Sam Cho, Teresa Mosqueda, Girmay Zahilay, and many more.

Five-minute response times for priority 911 calls, get guns off our streets, shut down open-air drug markets, help neighborhood small businesses recover, address addiction and the mental health crisis. It’s also unacceptable that three years after the murder of George Floyd, Seattle still has no alternative to armed response to 911 calls. Not all situations require uniformed police officers, but some do. I’ll prioritize making this happen. I will also bring people together to build more affordable housing and address the homelessness crisis.   My parents moved from Puerto Rico to the Bronx in search of a better life. My dad was a welder and proud union member, and my mom worked at a factory. I moved to Seattle twenty years ago after working in the Clinton White House as the Hispanic Community Liaison and for the ACLU fighting Islamophobia.

I work at my district office and hold weekly office hours to hear from you directly. Public Safety: Yes, “defund the police” was a mistake. I’ve supported fully funding the police staffing and hiring plans every year, created a public safety coordinator in Ballard, increased Harbor Patrol, and funded Mobile Crisis teams. I’ll continue fully funding the police and working to make policing better and safer. Homelessness: I resolved the Woodland Park and Ballard Commons encampments without sweeps, expanded outreach teams working with people living in cars, and created neighborhood-based homelessness response teams. We need to expand our efforts to get homeless people into housing, build and buy permanent housing, and push regional partners to act faster. Housing: I cut red tape to build housing faster and launched audits on our permitting process. I reduced eviction threats for tenants while ensuring landlords are made whole. We must increase the stock of family-size units so people of all income levels can afford it here. Raised in District 6, I’m committed to our community’s success. I want to raise my kids in a neighborhood that is safer than the one I grew up in. I’ve dedicated my life to public service, serving with AmeriCorps and working to combat gun violence. I’ve delivered for our city by bringing people together to find common ground. Things are better, but better's not good enough.  I ask for your vote to keep the momentum.

Seattle City Council should focus on addressing critical issues. Our city is at a crossroads. It is imperative that we elect a pragmatic Council, committed to real solutions for addressing homelessness and public safety. I love Seattle. I grew up here and ran Fremont’s iconic Red Door for two decades. Now, I serve as Executive Director of the Fremont Chamber of Commerce, working on issues for small businesses and neighbors. I understand the critical ground-level needs in our neighborhoods. I’ll take bold steps to improve Seattle. Simply put, Seattle deserves better leadership.My priorities are clear:Community Safety: The incumbent City Council needs to be held accountable for their vocal support to defund the police. We need a council that makes responsible decisions, even in difficult situations. I’ll focus on restoring police staffing levels, and I’ll push for alternative first responders for situations that don’t require armed interventions. Housing & Homelessness: The homelessness crisis demands swift and effective action. Our incumbent City Council has failed to act on this urgent issue. Short-term, we need to increase shelter availability, establish additional tiny home villages, and improve mental health and drug treatment services. In the long run, we must expand housing options and expedite the permitting process. We need to act urgently to provide much-needed support for our most vulnerable citizens. Our current city council can’t be trusted to make the tough decisions necessary to keep us moving forward. I’m running because we need a more pragmatic, problem-solving approach to shape Seattle’s shared future. Endorsed: Seattle Times and hundreds of your neighbors who want change. I’m Pete Hanning, and I ask for your vote.",

In my first term, I brought together unlikely coalitions to deliver results and I’ll continue that work if re-elected.Public Safety: In my first term, I increased our park ranger program from two to 28 rangers, fully funded the police hiring budget each year, passed an ordinance protecting firefighters from harassment in the line of duty, and worked with Mayor Harrell to create a civilian behavioral health response in lieu of police involvement. If re-elected, I’ll increase these alternative responses, continue the shared commitment of the Council and Mayor to recruit and retain police, and support community programs proven to reduce repeated criminal behavior and interrupt gun violence.Housing And Homelessness: We need to get people out of encampments and into stable housing immediately. Working with Mayor Harrell, my office helped create the Unified Care Team, a one-stop, no-excuses shop to navigate people experiencing homelessness into shelter and resolve encampments. Encampments have been reduced by 42%, but much work remains. Over the next four years, I’ll increase enhanced shelter options like tiny houses so people experiencing homelessness have a stable shelter, rather than being displaced to another encampment. I’ll also work with city partners to build and acquire social and non-profit housing so more people can afford to live in our community.Climate Change: We are running out of time to combat climate change. Seattle must confront the emergency with housing planning that emphasizes dense, walkable communities, electrification of buildings, and safe, reliable public transportation.Rated strongly aligned by the Downtown Seattle Association.Endorsements: MLK Labor, 36th and 43rd Democrats, Alliance for Gun Responsibility Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, Attorney General Bob Ferguson, Executive Dow Constantine",

I’ll help lead our city to meet the challenges we face on public safety, public health, and homelessness. Seattle can feel like a thriving, vibrant community again. I’m a first-generation American, civic leader, and stay-at-home dad supporting my wife’s work as a Civil Rights Attorney – including the landmark case with the ACLU overturning “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” I volunteer with several neighborhood-level public safety and community organizations, including as former Chair of the Queen Anne Community Council’s Public Safety Committee. We need to get serious about crime reduction. The Council’s pledge to defund SPD by 50% was irresponsible and undercut our public safety and our ability to implement reform. I support allocating additional resources to recruitment, retention, training, and community policing – including non-police responders – to prevent crime and decrease response times. We cannot solve our public safety issues without addressing public health. The City Council has enabled open drug use and dealing in our neighborhoods including Downtown, which claimed the lives of 500+ Seattleites last year and is contributing to violent crime. We must add mental health hospital bed capacity and addiction treatment centers, but we also need principled leadership to build partnerships and demand accountability. I’ll prioritize programs and service providers that prove they work. With increasing shelter space, it’s time to restore our public spaces and stop relying on unsafe, inhumane encampments. I’ll partner with the Mayor and focus Seattle government on saving lives, keeping the vulnerable safe, and restoring our beautiful city.  I’m a pragmatic progressive who believes that ground-level results are more important than political platitudes.

I will fight against the Houghton transfer station being moved to our tourist district.  I will work to improve public safety for all residents and preserve our parks, so we never lose the natural beauty that surrounds us.  I am grateful for your support.   Endorsements: Mayor Mike Millman, City Councilmembers Lester Rubstello, Sarah Arndt, Michelle Evans",

I prioritized expanding student voice, maintaining a sustainable fiscal balance sheet, equitable access and allocation of resources, and keeping excellent teachers.  My passion for quality public schools, nearly 30-years as a leader in the financial services industry, and education in business have led me to this role.    I pledge to advocate for increased support for school safety, increased STEAM programing, more inclusive and robust Highly Capable programs, and increased extracurricular activities that enrich students’ learning experiences. Collaboration with parents, teachers, and administrators will be the foundation of my approach to address challenges and seize opportunities effectively.  I am endorsed by the Mayor of Kent, 47th District Democrats, King County Council Chair Dave Upthegrove (D) and Vice-Chair Reagan Dunn (R), and many others. It takes all voices to make this a great district, and I want to continue to bring those voices and oversight to Kent School District.",

My own passion for education has its roots in my grandmother's limited opportunities in segregated schools during the Jim Crow era. She knew she wanted better for my father, and then for me. Her relentless drive and sacrifices enabled us to attend excellent schools on the East Coast. Since moving into LWSD with my own family 10 years ago, I’ve witnessed the high-quality education offered in public schools here. I’ve also been frustrated by unnecessary hurdles that prevent students from reaching their full potential. Today, these hurdles are often invisible, but they are every bit as real as the ones my grandmother faced. In my career as a program manager at Microsoft, I’ve learned the importance of actively seeking feedback from various stakeholders and prioritizing resources to drive towards impactful solutions. As an LWSD board director, I will use the skills and experiences I’ve developed at Microsoft and as a parent to make our schools more effective, equitable, and inclusive for all students. I believe that together, we can make LWSD schools better for everyone.

During the pandemic I volunteered at COVID test sites and in our schools. After the Ingraham High shooting I worked directly with students, parents, and staff to review district policies and champion gun violence prevention. I’ve led inclusive education policy changes in Instructional Philosophy and Special Education. As the Board’s Legislative Liaison, I helped secure additional state resources for special education (WA State is now finally in federal compliance!), as well as access to career and technical education, and needed behavioral health support for students. I led efforts to ban isolation and limit restraint in SPS– practices that disproportionately impact students of color and with disabilities. Our policy is now a state model for preventative and restorative practices.  Together, we can meet the needs of our diverse learners and make our public schools the top choice for education for Seattle’s families. I’m committed to navigating budget and enrollment challenges with transparency, clarity, and community partnership– to maximize student benefit while operating within our means. I will continue putting my skills and experience to work to rebuild not only trust and confidence, but joy and excitement throughout our education system.

School closures have deep and lasting impacts on communities and should be an absolute last resort after exhausting all other options to balance the budget. The inequities in academic achievement need urgent attention and focus to make Seattle Public Schools the exemplary learning environment students deserve. My priorities as a School Board Director will be: Calling for a district-wide audit to ensure dollars are spent with fiscal accountability; ensuring students can thrive and feel safe while gaining a high-quality education, no matter their identity; implementing a stronger community engagement process, especially when big district decisions are made, that centers communities furthest from educational opportunities; bringing transparency back in the budget and policy development processes. Representation matters. I’m running to bring a strong LGBTQ+ voice to the school board and ensure students of all identities feel a sense of belonging at school. I bring experience from the classroom, the workplace, and the community. I taught English as a second language in Renton. I have served on the Best Start for Kids Advisory Board, as Executive Director of an LGBTQ+ nonprofit, as an Interim Policy Director for the National Alliance on Mental Illness Washington, and as mobilization contractor for Children’s Alliance.

Buildings need updating. Care for our communities must be present in the district's response to incidents and emergencies. Students need equitable access to social and emotional care, anti-racist environments, and culturally responsive academic supports. I’m not a politician, I’m an educator.

While visiting and volunteering in schools, I have seen the importance of not just attracting qualified teachers, but of retaining them, by giving them the support they need to help students thrive. Every student has unique needs, and that is why I am committed to advocating for increased school funding, strengthening our partnerships with families and community organizations, and codifying every students’ right to have a voice in the decisions that affect them.   Seattle Public Schools is facing a budget deficit over the next few years, and I want to continue to work with you, and our entire SPS community, to ensure that public input is actively sought out and utilized, in advance of looming tough decisions. As a woman of color, who grew up poor and faced housing insecurity, I believe that every voice should be heard, especially those of our LGBTQ+, Black, Indigenous, families of color, and those who have historically been underrepresented due to obstacles in participating in our public systems. I would be honored to have your vote. Endorsements: King County Democrats; 36th District Democrats; 32nd District Democrats; Alliance for Gun Responsibility Victory Fund; State Senator Javier Valdez; Seattle School Board Director Vivian Song Maritz; Shoreline School Board Director Rebeca Rivera; Edmonds School Board Director Carin Chase; Education and Economic Justice Advocate Summer Stinson; The Stranger; and others.

Essential to the project of systemic change is a commitment to centering families furthest from educational justice. As the parent of three SPS students, one of my core beliefs is that we advocate most effectively for our own children when we advocate for all children. I’m running for school board because I believe every child in this city is entitled to a high quality education- defined by rigor, relevance and relationships- no matter what neighborhood they live in.  In order to effectively address disparities in our schools we must align our district to focus on student outcomes, so that every child in this city receives the education they deserve. A system that is responsive to the needs of kids is, by definition, an equitable system. My top priorities include: 1) addressing the youth mental health crisis by increasing the number of trained mental health professionals in buildings, promoting mental health awareness and destigmatization, and using our schools as hubs to connect students and their families to wrap around services, 2) fostering transparency and responsible financial management through increased community engagement, seeking input from parents, educators, and community members to ensure that our financial decisions align with the needs and priorities of our diverse community, and 3) expanding equitable access to advanced learning opportunities for all students. I chose a career in filmmaking because I believe stories shape how we see and understand the world.

I’m running for School Board because I believe that we can meet this challenge and build great schools for all families.  I’ve called Seattle home for 20 years– fighting for housing affordability as the Executive Director of the Washington Low Income Housing Alliance, and working at leading technology companies. I’m a proud SPS parent. I have been endorsed by the Seattle Times, the 32nd Legislative District Democrats, former Seattle School Board members, and SPS parents looking for change.  We need systemic change to address urgent needs. After a student died from gun violence at Ingraham High School there was little to no response. The Board and District intend to close neighborhood schools and have ended vital enrichment programs. Students furthest from educational justice are, using the District’s own measures, worse off than they were in 2019. Budget concerns are a result of a fundamentally unsound financial footing. As a result, many parents who can are leaving for private schools. We deserve a School Board that takes gun violence seriously. We deserve a Board that fights to keep neighborhood schools open and offer programs that draw students in. We deserve a Board that does more than talk about improving outcomes for kids most in need of help, but insists on results. I don’t have all the answers, but I believe that bringing in new voices is the first step to getting back on the right track.  In their endorsement, the Seattle Times noted my “willingness to speak truth to power and dive into the details.”  With your vote I’ll be a strong, unwavering voice for accountability, results, and more importantly- our kids.",

Parents, students, and teachers need to be better informed and consulted about education demands and budget priorities. \"Maryanne Wood's impassioned candidacy, spurred by her opposition to what she calls the \"mega school\"  plan, should serve as a barometer of community sentiment...It is also a reflection of anger across the district at a marked  lack of transparency around the current school board's decision-making.\"  - The Seattle Times Editorial Board. SPS's decision making process lacks transparency. Elect me to the School Board and I will work tirelessly to change that. Seattle Public Schools faces declining enrollments, budget deficits, elimination of resources and programs, possible closures, consolidation, teacher and staff layoffs according to an article published by the Seattle Times in April of 2023.  SPS is facing an estimated $131 million deficit for 2023-24 and $92 million for 2024-25 yet they are still planning to construct large, one-size-fits-all buildings to replace aging school. I live by the one planned for Alki Elementarty. A consolidation is a closure.These new schools provide no parking for staff or parents. ADA parking is insufficient.The Alki school rebuild and remodel is an example of this.  I will work to make sure these projects are scaled back if they don't have full community support. ADA parking and transportation needs must be given priority because if you can't get your child safely to the school, they can't be educated. As a grassroots candidate I would appreciate your vote,Endorsed by Vicki Schmitz, whose family donated the land for Schmitz Park Elementary and Scott Pinkham ( first Native American to serve on the SPS Board )",

Ensuring the mission and the vision of the school is met by developing policy, curriculum and managing budget.",

As a teacher at Vashon Island High School for thirty-three years, I have seen educational trends come and go, but the core mission to provide high-quality education for all students remains the same. A perennial challenge is funding, mostly due to how our state allocates money. As the former negotiator for the Vashon Education Association, I am well acquainted with this issue. It is the Board’s duty to be fiscally responsible. This requires careful consideration, intense listening, and to gather information from the people affected by the School Board’s decisions. I recognize that our District faces new challenges due to economic, technological, and social change. I strive to be open minded, without a preconceived agenda, to work hard, and do my best. Endorsed by: Vashon Education Association Council, National Women's Political Caucus",

Misplaced priorities, secrecy, and risk aversion at the expense of our children’s safety and education has fostered a deep mistrust of our institution.  I have experience and leadership skills required to effectuate tangible improvements. Change is needed when inequities, policy violations, or impactful budgetary constraints arise. I can make difficult decisions and recognize when challenging the status quo is needed.    I’m an experienced manager, labor relations professional, public servant, and mother of two children in the district who is willing to be accountable and transparent in my actions, to represent the interests of, and commitment to, educators, students, and families.",

Multiple, ongoing instances of student sexual predation by adults who were charged with their education and care require a deep consideration of our collective responsibility and a forensic examination of how this was allowed to go on for so long. New leaders must steward a process of repair and reflection with bold and ambitious vision. I commit to center the students furthest from educational justice, including students of color, English language learners, members of the LGBTQIA+ community, and neurodivergent learners. Doing so will improve the outcomes and day-to-day experiences of all VISD students. As a longtime community organizer, my volunteer and board experience includes the Vashon Food Bank, VIGA’s Food Access Partnership, and the Vashon Green School.",
