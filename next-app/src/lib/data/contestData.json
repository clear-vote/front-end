Elect prosperous Goodspaceguy to the King County Council.Please, think of Earth as a spaceship. In our King County on our Spaceship Earth, let us expand our minds and help raise the living standard by abolishing the job-destroying, crime-promoting Minimum Wage. The Minimum Wage promotes homelessness and shoplifting and other crimes and Job Stress. If we successfully declare the Minimum Wage unconstitutional, then low-paying, therapeutic jobs for the Homeless can return into existence. Employed people make safer people. The crime rate and the cost of living can come down. Let us move towards full employment.Prediction: Improving technology will raise the living standard. With your help, King County could become a leader in the new and upcoming orbital space colonization industry. Elon Musk and other leaders are opening the high frontier. Life's new destiny is to rise up and gradually colonize Orbital Space around our Earth and around our Sun. Imagine many of your descendants gradually moving up to the amazement of living in the upcoming Orbital Space Colonies. Start small.In King County, let us see how high we can raise the living standard by helping to un-sabotage the Economy. Let Supply and Demand, in search of Profits, adjust wages and prices to Equilibrium. Profits are the Incentives that create Employment. Greater Profits, greater Employment! Make it easy for the homeless and people-with-problems to get jobs. Make us a safer King County of employment. Let us embrace the Free Market Economy of Capitalistic Consumerism.

A billion-dollar terminal unsuitable for some of the large jets, $800 million in cost overruns, and a half-million loss to an internet scam. A staggering $83 million of new tax levy. Persistent environmental lawsuits hurting low-income communities and people of color in South King County. Time to set a new course. We have a shared goal: A thriving economy, a cleaner environment, increased family wage jobs, and a fair and equitable society. To attain this, we must stop the path of mismanagement.  With my extensive career in banking and finance, I am ready to steer the Port in the right direction. As an immigrant who arrived with $300, I've worked my way up from the mailroom to the boardroom, founded two community banks, and provided hundreds of millions in small business loans and created thousands of jobs. I am a staunch promoter of fiscal responsibilities and know how to leverage them to create business opportunities for Washington State. I’ve served as a volunteered mentor MBA students at Seattle University, active in Rotary for 38 years, and Past President of the Greater Seattle Chinese Chamber of Commerce.  If elected, I will immediately put sound management practices into place to pull the Port back onto firm financial ground with transparency. This will enable us to focus on our dual mission: Generating family-wage jobs and safeguarding our environment.

I’m running for a third term to continue my environmental leadership advancing a just and inclusive transition to a clean energy economy that generates living wage careers.  My service is guided by a triple bottom line: commerce, community, and climate. I’m committed to expanding environmental and economic justice, especially for near-port communities, small and minority owned businesses.  My experience is needed to exercise public policy direction over a growing airport, homeport for cruise ships and fishing fleet, marinas, parks, and marine cargo Alliance with the Port of Tacoma.  The Port generates 121,000 jobs which is key to ongoing COVID recovery efforts.  The airport and seaport have won awards for customer service even while undergoing major construction. Port activities also impact communities and the climate.  That’s why I’m leading initiatives to electrify airport and seaport operations and use of alternative fuels for trucks, ships, and planes.  I’m also committed to ensuring the protection and restoration of parks, bicycle safety and cleanup of the Duwamish River.  During my next term I’ll continue reducing the Port’s carbon footprint with unprecedented state and federal funding for clean energy projects; inspire youth to pursue Port-related jobs by promoting innovation, apprenticeships, and internships; and expand partnerships with Tribes and the Seattle Aquarium for projects on kelp to killer whales and ecotourism.  With your support, I’ll continue to champion Port policies rooted in fiscal responsibility, ecological integrity, and social equity.

I want to continue this work to bring more diversity and ideas into the Port—and its partners—through internships and apprenticeships, pipelines through our high schools and colleges to engage the workforce of tomorrow.     Sea-Tac Airport is reaching capacity and no new airport will be built anytime soon– protecting rural lands, but forcing the Port to manage increasing flights, crowds, and security issues at our existing facility. My experience will be critical in addressing these challenges.  The Port must be a better neighbor to the communities it serves, and steward of our environment—meeting carbon reduction goals, accelerating adoption of clean fuels and renewable energy, and better integrating with the regional transportation network to move freight, people, and commerce.  I grew up with a father who fought in a segregated WWII Marine unit, and a Honduran mother who spoke Spanish in our home. As Port Commissioner I  will respect the values of fairness, equity, and opportunity that united our home—and our region.

The future of our nation lies in the education they receive today. She will prioritize civics education. Also, mental health therapy should be normalized to remove ableism and stigma. Affordable housing: Census reports indicate Seattle’s population is still growing. Seattle continues to face this crisis and Lucy is ready to engage with stakeholders to strategically seek and use allocated resources and streamline city services.  Homelessness: Seattle is getting federal funding and Lucy is ready to support viable programs to address root causes for homelessness in our diverse communities. Seattle must spend responsibly and invest in self-sustainable programs. She is ready to partner-up to build an effective revitalization downtown program for Pioneer Square and beyond. Transportation: Lucy supports development without displacement, longer tunnels please! Elevated concrete bridges continue to fail: WS bridge, 99 Alaskan Way viaduct (1950-2013), and recently NB-HWY 99. She wants to avoid another “Seattle Monorail Failure”! Sound Transit came to a halt with the main corridor. Stakeholders in CID, Ballard, and WS have not bought-in, but ST is pushing hard to start building the WS extension. The ST measure passed in 2016 with 57% in King and 51% in Snohomish, but failed in Pierce County. The property taxes and car tab increases hurt our most vulnerable communities. Stop displacements and save green spaces! It’s time to place this measure back on the 2024 ballot. Voters must decide to keep this going for 13+ years or seek a leaner project. Visit her website for more information. Please vote for Lucy as your councilwoman, District 1!",

We also need a renewed push to develop middle-income housing so that nurses, teachers, mechanics and those on fixed incomes can continue to call Seattle their home. Let’s further restrict access to guns and promote safety in every neighborhood. I will support our small businesses and help revitalize Downtown.I have the ideas, skills and leadership experience to move our city forward.  I began to consider running for council a few years ago when I decided to keep Eltana Bagels open and un-boarded during the height of the George Floyd protests and ensuing CHOP occupancy. I could have followed the vast majority of businesses at the time and closed my doors or joined some of my neighboring businesses in their grievance lawsuit against the city. I did not. Instead, I listened to the needs of the community and my employees. Everyone kept their jobs and our doors stayed open. That is leadership and that is what is sorely needed on the Seattle City Council. I am driven by bringing the best ideas to light and to life. I am the only candidate in the District 1 race who has developed ideas into plans that actually work. Not only that, I have used those plans to create entities that have operated successfully for long stretches of time. I lead with the values of candor, curiosity, and generosity.

I am a feminist, a proud member of the LGBTQIA2s+ community, breast cancer survivor, and loving Italian Mama to 8 children in our blended family. We need all of us participating to solve the complex problems we face in our post-pandemic society, including: public safety concerns in our neighborhoods; income inequality; greater affordability in housing; business growth and development; parental leave and addressing the childcare crisis; reimagining transportation corridors to support amenities and work; and equality of opportunity realized in the promise of liberty and justice for all.As a councilmember, I will lead with unwavering commitment to District 1 where everyone is engaged, respected, and valued.

Everyone has a right to feel safe in their neighborhood, free of crime or unequal justice. We must enact Both effective prevention strategies And appropriate response capabilities to meet the realities of today’s public safety challenges.While growing up, I lived in public and low-income housing. These experiences taught me that everyone deserves safe, quality affordable housing in a thriving community. A severe lack of housing for people at all income levels means that those at the bottom are suffering the most. We must build more affordable housing, particularly low-income housing and workforce housing for middle income residents.As a former foster kid, I know what it’s like to be completely uprooted and swept away. We must do better for our unhoused neighbors. Sadly, the homelessness crisis in our city has devolved into a total humanitarian catastrophe. It is our moral imperative to take urgent action and find people housing and treatment now.At City Hall, I want to normalize collaborating across differences, finding common ground, and getting bold things accomplished that work for everyone.

As an active Seattle Public Schools volunteer, I’m passionate about the health and future for our kids– from gun violence prevention to immediate climate action.The standard to help others had been shaped by the example of my grandmother who demonstrated the virtue of selflessness and humility during her lifetime as she cared for many people in profound need and left the world a better place because of her courage.

I put my career on the line and led thousands of my coworkers to take an unprecedented stand. I outlined a plan to win, did the work, and delivered results. Our actions led to Amazon’s Climate Pledge, Bezos’s $10 billion Earth Fund, and increased worker safety. Now I want to help District 1 and Seattle rise to the challenges of our times. We must make rapid, meaningful progress on public safety, homelessness, affordable housing, and climate change. There are more unsheltered people on our streets than ever. Immediately, we need to increase stable permanent housing and coordinate with regional partners to ensure that those experiencing homelessness have paths to necessary resources. We need to feel safe in our neighborhoods and parks. We can have police and alternative responses; lead with compassion and refuse to tolerate harmful behavior; and tackle poverty, mental illness, and addiction so that crime decreases. I will be a strong advocate for bringing response times down, while ending racial bias and excessive force.Climate change is here and our city isn’t ready. With new federal funding, I will help lead our city to reduce emissions and protect residents from heatwaves, smoke, and flooding. My vision for Seattle is to establish holistic public safety, end homelessness, and lead the world into the new green economy.

I want this community to sustain in these radically changing times. I spent nearly 5 years attempting to enter into the local legislative process as a private citizen and found it systematically impossible to do so. This led me to recognize the inadequacy of our current process when trying to best address our issues. My experience growing up in a union family has shown me the impact that a culture of solidarity, democracy, and community organization can have when negotiating relationships of power and creating policy that effectively serves the collective.My campaign is rooted in systemic change so that we can better address the problems we face in our community. If elected, I will work to improve citizen access to the legislative process, to introduce transparency and accountability within our system of local governance, and to celebrate community organization and empowerment. I believe that we have outgrown the system of representation as we collectively step into a new era of being human. Our current technological advancement has created a fundamentally different kind of citizen. We now have access to the information needed to become a valuable contributor to the conversation which creates legislation. We can coordinate within large numbers in a digital space to discuss our local policies 24 hours a day. It is time to shift our focus from the powers that be - to the powers that we have become.",

City Council has spent countless millions on our homelessness crisis. Despite that, hundreds of our unhoused neighbors have died, and our parks and public spaces have deteriorated. Meanwhile, City Council has failed to even deliver a contract to fully fund basic police services. It’s unacceptable. Everyone deserves to feel safe and comfortable in their neighborhood. Like you, I want a Seattle that keeps its promises. That should start with the City Council.I’ll bring unmatched experience on these issues to the Council. My service includes being an Administrative Law Judge, Public Defender and community leader. Every day in my hearings I learn about our neighbors’ struggles. From property crime to gun violence to affordability issues, I understand our toughest community challenges. In my volunteer work, I try to solve those challenges by bringing people together to find common ground and by focusing on measurable progress. I successfully organized thousands of neighbors to push for results on the West Seattle Bridge. On City Council, I’ll work just as hard for you.We all know what matters. Seattle should be safe, clean, and prosperous. We should invest in both unarmed crisis responders and police staffing.

I’ve got the experience to organize community-centered approaches and I secure the investments to match. We deliver on our values rather than simply profess them.My office has a proven track record of progressive action. We committed to investing in historically under-funded schools, so we funded mental health in Southend schools. We said we’d prevent displacement, so we won tenant protections, monumental worker protections like paid sick leave for gig workers, and secured rent control for our small businesses. I secured permanent funding for community-driven development, and for the Green New Deal. All this and more in difficult times.Let’s advance these wins even further. I envision housing abundance and vibrant small businesses within reach of all generations who stay rooted in their community. Children with full stomachs and single mothers with full wallets. Community networks preventing violence rather than just reacting to it. We’ve only just begun building alternatives to punishment and incarceration—especially for our Black and brown neighbors who suffer from the paradox of over-policing and under-policing.Let’s deepen our investments in care and shared prosperity. We all deserve to feel safe in our neighborhoods. As a mom with 2 kids in Seattle Public Schools, it’s important to me that all our children are safe whether they’re walking to school or enjoying the park.

I’ve seen how South Seattle has changed, I’ve seen what happens to neighborhoods that don’t have a voice and are expected to live with bad city policies. I want to change that. As a community advocate, I’ve fought against continued discrimination from the city towards the CID, recently named one of the most endangered neighborhoods in America. I learned that fighting for our voice when the city imposes their will without listening to our community, is a fight we can win. I want to bring that same passion to fight for all of South Seattle. I know how to achieve better public safety. Every week, I practice what alternative policing looks like with my community watch group that prevents violence while working with first responders when needed, and provides mutual aid to the unhoused in the CID.  I know how to create more affordable housing. My family renovated the historic Louisa Hotel into workforce housing which only charges residents a percentage of their income so nobody is charged rent they cannot afford. This model can be used to fight displacement and gentrification across South Seattle. We need to move past elected leaders telling us what they're going to do, but never showing up to hear what people really want. We need leaders that listen to the community even when it's not politically convenient, and do the hard work it takes to run Seattle. Together we can uplift South Seattle to be the place we know it can be.  I promise to show up, work hard and help make Seattle better, together.  Endorsed by Representative Sharon Tomiko-Santos, Seattle Port Commissioners Sam Cho and Toshiko Hasegawa, and more.",

I vividly remember sitting in a coffee shop in Kirkland looking South towards Mt. Rainier – the sky an impossible blue where you can see for miles and Mt. Rainier took my breath away. I moved to Seattle in 2012, into the Belltown neighborhood, where I lived for 5 years. In 2017 I moved to Rainier Beach where I’ve lived ever since. We have a lot of serious issues facing us as citizens of Seattle and I’d like to mention three things we need to directly address: Universal Citywide Single Payer Healthcare, The Right to Shelter and a Real Living Wage.Healthcare is a right and we need to enact legislation to make this right a reality. Following the models of Healthy San Francisco and NYC Health+Hospitals, the City of Seattle should establish a universal healthcare access program to ensure all residents receive free, at point of service, healthcare without relying on employer-sponsored plans or private insurance.The City of Seattle should establish rent control and renter’s rights, end exclusive single-family zoning, ban new AirBNB developments, establish high-density, mixed incoming housing near transit centers, and the City should expand cooperative housing, expand social housing and make it easier to enter and sustain home-ownership for Seattle residents.The City of Seattle should adopt a $25/hr true living wage which is automatically adjusted based on the cost of healthcare, housing, food, transportation and inflation. I’m running for Seattle City Council in District 2 because I believe we can change our city if we take bold action now. Vote for me in District 2 for an Evergreen future.",

We’ve been hindered by political games, inflexibility, indecisiveness, and special interest money. We can’t afford more of the same. I decided to run the day my son was born. I need him to grow up in a place where leaders behave like leaders and respond to their neighbors when they are called upon. In my role as a husband, father, business owner, care provider, activist, and substitute teacher I’ve learned that the most important piece of our lives is how we can be of service to our community. I would like to serve because we need one million square feet of “home” for our homeless neighbors within the next three years. Allowing for temporary sanctioned encampments for those unready to come inside, ending the practice of sweeps, and adding wrap-around services will allow people build self-sufficient lives of meaning. Additionally, we’re going to reinstate the free ride zone so that Seattle becomes a leader on public transit opportunities for people nationwide. Immediately, we need to leave the war on drugs behind and invest in education, support services, and job training. I will work to create a jobs pipeline into new public safety models for formerly incarcerated persons so that those with lived experience can be the next case workers, crisis responders, and more. My campaign is being run exactly how I’ll run my office; with hard work, direct conversations, and building solutions.

Many of my clients were chronically homeless, suffering from substance use disorders as well as co-occurring mental illnesses. I know it’s possible to treat people with respect while still expecting responsibility.My experience with mental illness isn’t just professional, but also personal.  In 2015, I was confronted with a difficult diagnosis at 30 years old.  It shattered my identity, and the stigma inspired suicidal thoughts. Fortunately, I found a supportive community and the right combination of medications, and I’ve been stable now for six years.  I’m sharing this for two reasons: to confront the stigma, but also, because I recognize we need to be accountable for our own mental health. If elected I will work to reconcile the trust gap between the community and SPD.  We need more officers out of cars and patrolling streets on foot and by bike. I will provide housing subsidies to both help attract new officers and make sure more of our officers are patrolling the streets of the communities they live in. We will prioritize community safety, not just officer safety.I promise to stay accountable and accessible, and to prioritize ideas that are practical and actionable.",

Our campaign is building momentum to keep Seattle as progressive as we can with a focus on shelter, safety, and sustainability.Together, we will establish a universal “right-to-shelter,” pass robust renter protections and rent control, work to reform our strained policing system (in partnership with the BIPOC community) in building specific alternatives to those more traditional response models, and create America’s first carbon free city by 2030. I believe that we get more done for the city and its residents when we put aside divisive rhetoric and work together toward a common goal. Inspired by the work of Senator Sanders, I identify as a pragmatic Democratic Socialist and believe that I’m the most progressive candidate running for this seat. Furthermore, as a lifetime Sierra Club member and activist with Extinction Rebellion, Seattle will never see a stronger advocate for protecting our environment and battling the impacts of climate change. As a third-generation union worker and member of two locals, I am deeply committed to go beyond business-as-usual and fight as a warrior for the labor movement and the working people of Seattle. We can do more to lift up wages and worker protections while also focusing on economic recovery. These are the values I will bring to the Council when elected. Our campaign is proudly endorsed by the King County Young Democrats, the Seattle Green Party, and the Green Party of Washington.

I would not be here today without sacrifice, community, and the occasional second chance. My early struggles are why I’m drawn to serve in the public sector, previously as part of the uniformed services, and currently, as an attorney in Mental Health Court. We’re living at an inflection point: the culmination of generations of deliberate disenfranchisement along racial lines exacerbating divisions in our country, and underinvestment in social services. Our task is not a simple one, we must invest in non-police responses for crisis intervention while also taking an aggressive stance on removing guns from our streets all while prioritizing rehabilitation for low level offenders to break the cycle. Simultaneously, we Must greatly expand our supply of affordable housing; maximize usage of existing inventory; minimize displacement of vulnerable communities; and ensure accessible transit for all. To this end, I’m committed to leveraging our social housing developer and creating 200K homes over the next ten years–anything less and we’ll only see the affordability crisis worsen. For Seattle to be successful, we must acknowledge there’s no going back to “how things were before.” We must take action to build a Seattle we can all be proud to pass on to the next generation. We must decarbonize our transportation system, invest in bold capital projects to redefine our city and improve quality of life.

Smart planning can improve livability, protect the environment and tree canopy, increase quality of life, and prevent many of the problems we face today due to shortsightedness.  I will work to safeguard growth that provides affordable housing for all stages and ages, and benefits neighborhoods without overstressing existing infrastructure.On Council, I’ll be your advocate for public safety, restoring police staffing to needed levels, and will make decisions that improve Seattle’s livability.  I’ll work to improve 911 response times, uplift and support our local businesses, and reestablish accountability in City Hall. With the right leadership, we can restore Downtown and the neighborhood business districts we are proud of.Seattle is a world-class city and deserves a councilmember who understands public works, supports local businesses, protects parks and schools, funds police and emergency responders, and acts to address homelessness effectively, compassionately, and immediately.  You have my pledge: I will be that Councilmember.

It really brought home that things are off track. I grew up in a tough neighborhood in the Bronx on the top floor of a five story walk up. My dad was a welder and proud union member, my mom worked in a factory. They moved from Puerto Rico seeking a better life.I found that life here in Seattle.  Unfortunately due to poor decisions and performative posturing by the City Council -- including pledging to defund the police -- our quality of life has eroded, neighborhood small businesses are struggling and our streets are less safe.  I’ll listen and work to end the divisiveness and put Seattle back on track.I’ll make public safety my top priority.  Five-minute response times for priority 911 calls, get guns off our streets, shut down open-air drug markets, address addiction and the mental health crisis. It’s also unacceptable that three years after the murder of George Floyd, Seattle still has no alternative to an armed response to 911 calls. Not all situations require police officers, but many do. I’ll prioritize. I will bring people together to build more affordable housing and address the homelessness crisis.  With more than 30 years in public service, I know how to get things done. I worked in the White House as President Clinton’s Hispanic liaison, for the National Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, in Seattle for the ACLU post 9/11 to protect Muslim communities from xenophobia, and for former Councilmember Tom Rasmussen. I am honored to have the endorsements of Attorney General Bob Ferguson, Former Councilmember Tom Rasmussen, and many others.With better governance, Seattle can be progressive, safe, and vibrant.

            "statement": "Hello! My name is George Artem, and I am running for Seattle City Council District 4.I came to the United States as a child from the ex-Soviet Union and the greater Seattle area has been my home for over three decades. I attended the University of Washington as an undergrad and completed a Master of Science in Information Systems from the same institution ten years later.My interest in politics began after the devastation of the second Bush administration. In 2008 I canvassed for President Barack Obama, and in 2016 I caucused with Democrats for Senator Bernie Sanders and later supported Dr. Jill Stein in the general election. I stayed out of the 2020 election cycle; but as I've gotten older and went to law school, I have found myself agreeing with more of what Washington State Republicans have to say and aligning with moderate conservatives like Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. However, in truth I’m a pragmatist that prefers solutions over parties.When I returned from law school, the city that I love had become unrecognizable. Previously bustling commercial districts had turned into open air drug markets, and tents lined the downtown streets. My primary motivation for running was to take action on drug possession, change our politics around policing, make rent affordable, and cut red tape and permitting costs so that Seattle can build.I believe in small government and local control. As a City Council member, I intend to use those as guiding principles to push back against Olympia’s one-size-fits-all policies and bring a culture of accountability to local government. Whether it be the City, the County, or the State, our leaders have raised and spent a lot of money in recent years, and the public has a right to know where it went.",

I had ample opportunities to meet neighbors and cultivate a sense of belonging. For decades I have watched North Seattle fill with big box stores and chain restaurants that smother our small businesses, drive down our wages and don’t invest in our local communities.We deserve housing and economic opportunities here in District 5. I will tirelessly advocate for development around our new transit stations and major roads, because density is responsible fiscal policy. I see North Seattle playing a pivotal role in our city’s expansion by modeling responsible housing density. We will create homes and jobs, all while minimizing the displacement of our neighbors.We deserve to live where we work. With my experience in real estate, I will be in close collaboration with the newly-developed social housing authority to create stability and security in Seattle’s cost of housing. No one who works in Seattle should have to worry about their cost of living outpacing their income. Properly funded social housing is an important tool for addressing our out-of-control housing and rental prices. We deserve to feel protected and respected when we call the city in need. Every day I support social and mental health workers in aiding those who rely on our systems for support, and I will bring this compassion and advocacy to the city council to develop a civic response force that will alleviate the unnecessary harm that can manifest from police response. It is expensive, harmful, and unjust to continue our current cycle of incarceration for people whose only crime is being poor. Seattle’s civil servants should show up when called and respond appropriately.",

We must enact pragmatic policies for sustainable solutions for accessible and affordable housing, increased wage parity, and improved working conditions for working families; Achieving multiple pathways toward shared goals around community safety; Improved multimodal transportation systems focused on pedestrian safety; Small business support focused on economic recovery and growth; Fixing infrastructure gaps throughout our city; Disability Justice and Intersectional Civic Empowerment.My policy change background includes co-organizing the passage of one of the nation's first bans of sub-minimum wage; successfully advocating for the adoption of Disability Justice principles at the Seattle Office of Civil Rights; co-organizing the fight for rent control, resulting in the six-month advance notice legislation passed by the council; and endorsing the Jumpstart Tax as a small business owner. We can find collective, effective, and sustainable policy solutions that get to the heart of the issues facing our district.

Deteriorating conditions confronting working people in Seattle are produced by the bosses as they squeeze ever more out of workers and farmers.After decades of attacks on our wages and working conditions, today there is a wind at the backs of workers who sense more opportunities to fight back. More workers and unionists are bringing to bear the class solidarity needed to effectively resist the accelerated speedup, longer hours, attacks on job safety, inflation-battered wages, lack of steady work, confronting the social and moral blight produced by world capitalism’s profit-driven crises of production and trade.The heart of U.S. politics today is the fight to defend constitutional freedoms won in struggle. Illegal searches and seizures, violations of due process, legislation by courts, government spying, and curbs on freedom of speech, and more, will be used against the working class. Working people need those rights to defend ourselves. Every attack on them must be vigorously opposed, regardless of who the target is today.Under the governance of the bosses’ parties what we win is soon taken away. When we depend on government to safeguard us, unelected bureaucracies, courts, and legislatures reverse our victories.We need affordable housing, health care, drug rehabilitation and mental health care; decent jobs, training, and child care; time off work with our families, and control of safety and working conditions on the job.  We need a labor party based on the unions, to organize working people to stand together in our own class interests. This is not a scheme, but a revolutionary perspective for our class. In 1959 the workers and farmers of Cuba proved that those who are utterly discounted by the ruling classes can take power and change the world.",

We need elected leaders who can focus on practical solutions and coalition building to address public safety, our housing crisis, and our transportation needs.In 2019, my son and I heard a car crash and ran outside. We ran into a police officer telling us to run inside, as he went on to confront the Sand Point mass shooter only 20 feet away. I believe the police saved our lives that day. We are all tired of false choices when it comes to public safety. We should be able to keep our neighborhoods safe without blaming our unhoused neighbors as the root of our problems.After the Parkland shootings, two moms and I organized to fundraise for and establish our nation’s largest gun buyback program. We need to continue our progress addressing our gun violence epidemic. I want to bring that passion, commitment, and proven collaborative working skills to Seattle City Council.These issues are heightened by our climate crisis with ever hotter days and stifling wildfire smoke.

We watch volunteers take action and get results, while the programs City Hall pours millions into seem ineffective. We have been patient and generous with our tax dollars, but we’re not getting our fair share or a fair say on spending. Accountability is my top priority. We need to enhance auditing of city expenditures, identify what is working and cut wasteful spending.Having lived in north Seattle for almost 25 years, some of you know me from my prior business, The Computer Doctor.

Affording rent, much less mortgage, is drifting out of reach for most residents. Seniors and students alike have to choose between moving out of city limits or facing tough choices. Basic problems are ignored in our bus network, making driving mandatory, and creating parking problems across the district. Aurora hasn't been invested in for decades, being so decrepit that neighbors avoid it when it could be a business area and urban hub. Across North Seattle, communities are ignored by city hall--most District Five neighborhoods have no community center or voice in Seattle's growth. As Seattle's youngest City Council member, Lucca will bring a fresh perspective for our district. He will listen to the community, and advocate for their solutions. Lucca worked on I-135, and will assure the Seattle Social Housing Developer is funded to relieve homelessness. Aurora should be a proper Main Street, by bringing bus, bike, and pedestrian infrastructure to places that don't have them.  Lucca's main priorities are transit, affordable housing, and community improvements.

I’m also a mutual aid organizer, a member of the Transit Riders Union, a board member for both Be: Seattle and the Housing Justice Project, as well as a displaced renter who is ready to represent your community on the Seattle City Council.As your councilmember, I will immediately focus my office’s attention on passing bold  progressive revenue to fill the projected $200 million shortfall in the 2024 budget. I will do this by increasing the Jumpstart tax on large corporations and implementing a capital gains wealth tax at the city level. Seattle residents are tired of regressive taxes that make every year harder and harder for working class families.Seattle must stop these pointless sweeps. We know they don’t work and they never will. Last year, the City carried out over 900 sweeps, many of them at the same location multiple times, with only a worsening homeless crisis to show for it. Our tax dollars should not be wasted; we need more public bathrooms, trash pickup, and hygiene stations - not sweeps.Finally, I will prioritize creating safe spaces for our kids, elders, and disabled neighbors through massive infrastructure investments. I will start by pedestrianizing Aurora with sidewalks, trees, and lit crosswalks. I will fight to make sure the 130th St station opens on schedule in 2026, with zoning that allows for dense, affordable housing in our district.Community members have already told us what they need to live and thrive in a safe, healthy Seattle; politicians simply need to say yes.

I’ve supported fully funding the Police staffing and hiring plans every year, created a Public Safety Coordinator in Ballard, increased Harbor Patrol, and funded Mobile Crisis teams. Next term, I’ll continue fully funding police and working with Mayor Harrell to make policing better and safer.Homelessness: I resolved the Woodland Park and Ballard Commons encampments without sweeps, expanded outreach teams working with people living in cars, and created neighborhood-based homelessness response teams. We need to expand our efforts to get homeless into housing, build and buy permanent housing, and push regional partners to act faster.Housing: I reformed the city’s processes to build housing faster and launched audits on our permitting process. I reduced the threat of eviction for tenants while ensuring landlords are made whole. We must increase the stock of family-size units so people of all income levels can afford it here.Born and raised in District 6, I’m committed to our community’s success because I want to raise my kids in a neighborhood that is safer than the one I grew up in.

Our city should guarantee a timely and reliable response to ensure vibrant neighborhoods where we can all live, work, and play. Uniformed officers play an essential role, but not every situation requires their response.Housing & Homelessness: Seattle must place the utmost importance on providing affordable housing to help working families, seniors and alleviate homelessness. To accomplish this, the city must direct its efforts toward expanding the current housing supply and expediting permitting processes while maintaining affordability and neighborhood character. For those experiencing homelessness, we must increase shelter availability, implement programs like tiny home villages, and enhance mental health and drug treatment services. Our ultimate focus should be prioritizing support for those requiring it the most.Seattle has been my beloved home for more than half a century.

We've taken the wrong approach to our problems, let them get worse, and used the wrong tools to manage them. Take homelessness. The current approach is to help people living on the streets so they can get back on their feet. The reality is most chronically homeless people have never been on their feet. Most suffer from mental illness and addiction problems. They don't need free meals or shelter. They need rehab and treatment. We need a Social Services Department to provide these services and handle many problems currently falling to the Seattle Police Department. Let's not criminalize homelessness, but treat it as a public health issue. If necessary, we should use civil commitment laws to mandate treatment for those who are a danger to themselves or others. We've also taken the wrong approach to housing, believing that more supply will lower prices. But despite all the homes we've built, rents and prices still rise. That's because private developers only build market rate housing as long as market rates remain high. We need to build affordable housing for people who earn at or below the median income. The new social housing office is a step in this direction. Addressing homelessness and housing affordability will chart a new path for Seattle. People in crisis will get the help they need. The police can stay in their lane. Our libraries can be learning centers instead of de facto homeless shelters. Our jails will no longer function as mental institutions. Our parks will be free of tents and needles. Let's pull Seattle in this hopeful direction, toward a higher-quality of life for everyone.",

Traffic is a mess, housing is unaffordable, bridges are crumbling, and our neighbors are literally sleeping in the streets.  As President of Seattle Fair Growth, I have been advocating for housing for people of all incomes.Before I built a small business from scratch into one of the Fastest Growing Companies in Washington, I was a starving radio announcer barely able to pay rent.  I know what it is to live paycheck to paycheck. We must incentivize developers to build affordable housing on site, not pay a fee to build it somewhere else on cheaper land four years later.The recent update to Seattle’s Tree Ordinance is an example of the failure of our city’s leadership. Multiple amendments recommended by the Urban Forestry Commission were summarily rejected. Combined with the State’s Middle Housing Act, which requires multifamily zoning throughout Seattle, who stands for the trees? Are we the Emerald City or beholden to special interests? Subsidized multifamily housing close to transit is part of the balance that Seattle needs.

If re-elected, I’ll increase these alternative responses, continue the shared commitment of the Council and Mayor to recruit and retain police, and support community programs proven to reduce repeated criminal behavior.Housing And Homelessness: We need to get people out of encampments and into stable housing immediately. Working with Mayor Harrell, my office helped create the Unified Care Team, a one-stop, no-excuses shop to navigate people experiencing homelessness into shelter and resolve encampments. Encampments have been reduced by 42%, but much work remains. Over the next four years, I’ll increase enhanced shelter options like tiny houses so people experiencing homelessness have a stable shelter, rather than being displaced to another encampment.

Building more housing is the highest priority and will improve affordability, reduce inequality and homelessness, help mitigate climate change, create more walkable neighborhoods, and make transit more viable. Housing will also close the gap between workers and jobs, unlocking enormous economic potential. We will do this with permissive and flexible zoning, by streamlining development processes, and by aligning tax incentives.We must also improve our tax system. Our taxes are regressive and unstable, and the city faces major budget shortfalls. We should move to a land value tax, which will be more progressive, more consistent, increase tax revenue, and come at a lower cost to taxpayers. Land value taxes will encourage housing construction, discourage speculation, and ensure the public receives the full return on public investments, helping fund major transit projects.We must expand addiction treatment services, and work to get as many people into treatment as possible, reducing drug use and overdoses. We must expand homeless outreach and shelter, to ensure we are consistently working with all of our large and growing homeless population and that we have space indoors for them. Nobody should sleep outside or in their car.We must fully staff our police department, which is overworked and struggling to perform even its basic duties. Expanding social services will help reduce low-level property crime and save police time by addressing societal ills that the police are not meant for.I am optimistic about our future: our problems have solutions, and great things are possible. I ask for your vote to start building that future.",

I’ll help lead our city to meet the challenges we face on public safety, public health, and homelessness. Seattle can feel like a thriving, vibrant community again. I’m a first-generation American, stay-at-home dad and civic leader, having retired as a Naval officer to help support my wife’s work as a Civil Rights Attorney – including the landmark case with the ACLU, overturning “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” I volunteer with several neighborhood-level community organizations, including as Chair of the Queen Anne Community Council’s Public Safety Committee. As the only Democratic challenger in this race, I’ll bring concrete plans based on our shared Seattle values. I’m a realist who believes that ground-level results are more important than political platitudes. We need to get serious about crime reduction. The Council’s pledge to defund SPD by 50% was irresponsible and undercut our public safety and our ability to implement reform. I support allocating additional resources to recruitment, training, and community policing – including non-police responders.  We cannot solve our public safety issues without addressing public health. With increasing shelter space, it’s time to restore our public spaces and stop relying on unsafe, inhumane encampments. City Council has enabled open drug use and drug dealing in our neighborhoods including downtown, which claimed the lives of 500+ Seattleites last year. We need leadership able to partner with County, State, and Federal authorities, to add mental health hospital capacity and addiction treatment centers. We must also prioritize programs and service providers that prove they work. I’ll focus Seattle government on saving lives, keeping the vulnerable safe, and restoring our beautiful city. We can do this! I’m Bob Kettle, and I ask for your vote.",

As the parent of three SPS students, one of my core beliefs is that we advocate most effectively for our own children when we advocate for all children. We must align our district to focus on student outcomes, such that every child in this city receives the education they deserve.From running a summer program for children of East African refugees to teaching at the college level, I have spent time in the classroom and understand the unique challenges our educators face. From a parent perspective, my efforts to secure the support necessary for my child to thrive at school have been met with frustrating roadblocks. As a board member, I will hold myself accountable for advocating for policies that support and empower our educators to help our kids reach their full potential.Children are facing an unprecedented mental health crisis. Our schools are facing a budget crisis. And data show that too many students in our district are profoundly underserved. Addressing these issues requires big picture thinking and a systems approach to enacting meaningful change. Having served on PTAs and the Magnuson Park Advisory Committee, I understand that systemic change doesn’t happen overnight. I also understand that successful movements are grounded in relationship building, which is why I will advocate for inclusive engagement policies and proactive, transparent communication.I chose a career in filmmaking because I believe stories shape how we see and understand the world.

I am running for School Board because I believe that we can meet this challenge and build great schools for all families.I’ve called Seattle home for 20 years. I’ve fought for housing affordability as the Executive Director of the Washington Low Income Housing Alliance. I’ve worked at leading technology companies. I’ve been a proud SPS parent– volunteering for school plays, chess club, and fundraising events. Our kids have had dedicated, talented, and committed teachers. We need systemic change to address urgent needs. After a student died from gun violence at Ingraham High School there was little to no response. The Board and District intend to close neighborhood schools and have ended vital enrichment programs. Students furthest from educational justice are, using the District’s own measures, worse off than they were in 2019. The constant budget panic is a result of a fundamentally unsound financial footing with no plans to make real changes. As a result, many parents who can are leaving for private schools.We deserve a School Board that takes gun violence seriously. We deserve a Board that fights to keep neighborhood schools open and offer programs that draw students in. We deserve a Board that does more than talk about improving the education of the kids most in need of our help, but insists on results.

I led efforts to ban isolation and limit restraint in SPS – practices that disproportionately impact students of color and with disabilities. Our policy is a state model for preventative and restorative practices that address high needs and cultivate safe, culturally responsive learning environments that benefit all children. Together, we can meet the needs of our diverse learners and make our public schools the top choice for education for Seattle’s families.

I'm not an activist just a Seattle Public Schools graduate and father of 3 Seattle Public School's students who wants to see some stability , logic and fiscal responsibility return to Seattle Public Schools management.

Having my older children attending SPS, I have volunteered in numerous schools and have seen many challenges that our underserved and marginalized populations go through.In the past I have worked with a nonprofit organization and some alumni to help make a site a city landmark in Seattle. The Wilson Pacific site located in North Seattle, just north of greenlake was slated for demolition to build two “Mega” schools. This decision was voted on and approved and had a high impact from the HCC parents and supporters. Leaving community members and organization, little to no voice and displacing them. Now, the district is making the same move across the district.  I ask again, how is this cost effective and helping the needs of our students if SPS will dismantle their schools and community?Volunteering in our schools, I have seen the day to day our teachers face. As we look forward, we are looking at the changes that would be made to SPS under enrolled schools and those communities.  There are so many other ways we can look at the budget and help our students have tools they need to succeed.  We are a small school, and I hope to make some change and give our school the same opportunity to continue to educate our future leaders.I do have, questions and concerns, I will learn and I will adapt, I hope to help all our students across the district and our families and community in D1.",

Our public schools have been critical at bringing opportunity and learning to generations of Seattle’s children but we have much more work to do to increase academic achievement, ensure every student has a healthy and inclusive learning environment and the school district is managed with transparency and accountability.  I’ve lived in Seattle for 27 years and over the past 15 years, I served on the Best Start for Kids Advisory Board, as Executive Director of an LGBTQ+ nonprofit, as an Interim Policy Director for NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) Washington, and as Mobilization contractor for Children’s Alliance. I was a community organizer for Hotel and Restaurant Employees Local 8 and currently serve as the co-chair of the Policy and Advocacy Committee for the 46th District Democrats.  As Olympic Hills PTA Advocacy Chair, I have a firsthand understanding of the challenges and opportunities in our schools.I’m running to be a strong LGBTQ+ voice on the school board and ensure children of all identities feel a sense of belonging in their schools. The inequities in academic achievement still need urgent attention and focus to make the Seattle School District the exemplary learning environment we all want it to be. My vision in becoming a School Board Director is:Ensuring every student feels a sense of belonging in their school. That no matter what your identity is, students can thrive and feel safe while gaining a high-quality education; Implementing a robust community engagement process especially when big district decisions need to be made that center the communities farthest from educational opportunities; Bringing more transparency back in the budget and policy development process.I’m excited to take my experience in education, community organizing, and labor to get pragmatic results for all students.

I work at New Horizons Ministries with homeless young adults and a few grassroots organizations. I am running because I feel like low income familes which make up a significant majority of the population of Seattle aren't being heard nor truly represented. Also I am tired of the dumpster fire we call the education system. We are failing the children and disproportionally kids that are part of the BIPOC communities. Not to mention low income families and the kids that qualify for special education and those furthest from educational justice. I am considered 'low-income' born and raised. Sitting below the poverty line. I am a Native, a proud Cherokee and Nez Perce . A member and family in the  LGBTQIA 2 spirit community. I am neurodiverse as is my youngest. Which has received or are receiving special education services. As low-income my family depends on free meals at school, Apple Health, and Food Stamps. No one knows or understands the struggles of poverty like someone who's lived it or is living it. I feel that anywhere decisions are being made everyone should be present and have a say. My lived experience tells me that now is the best time to run for the school board position.

Elect me to the School Board and I will work tirelessly to change that. Seattle Public Schools faces declining enrollments, budget deficits, elimination of resources and programs, possible closures, consolidation, teacher and staff layoffs according to an article published by the Seattle Times in April of 2023.  SPS is facing an estimated $131 million deficit for 2023-24 and $92 million for 2024-25 yet they are still planning to construct large, one-size-fits-all buildings to replace aging schools.I live by Alki Elemetary which is proposed for a giant expansion despite city declining enrollment. This will harmfully close other schools. I will vote to halt and dial back this project. There are similar harmful projects at Montlake and Rogers Elementaries.The new schools provide no parking for staff or parents. ADA parking is insufficient.The Alki school rebuild and remodel is an example of this.  I will work tirelessly to  make sure projects are scaled back if they can't be paid for or don't have full community support.  If you can't get your chilld to the school, they can't be educated.Endorsed by Vicki Schmitz, whose family donated the land for Schmitz Park Elementary, Mia Jacobson, canidate for City Counsel District 1, Jennifer Reyes, Commercial Real Estate Profesional.",

Housing affordability threatens everyone – whether homeowners, seniors, renters or small business owners. Our homeless crisis leaves women and children to sleep out on the street because there is no room in the shelter. An “activist” Assessor can help. We’ve gone twice to Olympia to reform the senior and disabled property tax relief program. Now thousands of our neighbors can stay in their homes. Responding to our homelessness crisis, we found surplus public and vacant private property, which can be used for housing solutions. We have identified the land. We should put it to use. The housing shortage makes homes and apartments in King County so expensive. Smarter density can bring us more housing at a more affordable price. But our property tax system was never designed to handle annual assessed value increases of up to just over 50%. And while actual taxes, including those voter approved, are considerably less, in these inflationary times it literally hits home. I’ve been a tireless taxpayer champion. Homeowners, renters, and small businesses deserve a tax break. I'm working with Assessors statewide to save everyday people real money without gutting vital local services. I am proud to be endorsed by Democrats and Republicans, labor and business, and folks in Seattle and the suburbs. While much has been done, we must do more. I ask for your vote.",

I catch glimpses of myself learning how to ride a bike at New Holly, playing high school basketball for Franklin, and renting movies with my family at the old Hollywood Video. When I take that drive these days, I see all the opportunities and challenges before us in District 2. The skyrocketing cost of living is forcing people to work double shifts to pay for half the groceries. The lack of affordable homes has pushed our neighbors to live on street corners. Staffing shortages have led countless people to live in crisis without the immediate attention of first responders. In my first four years on the Council, my team and I have led major efforts to address these problems. My office formulated and passed one of the largest investments in mental health and addiction recovery in our state’s history with the Crisis Care Centers initiative. My office uplifted Skyway, leading to unprecedented investment in this neighborhood’s housing, transit, and community infrastructure. My office championed the building of thousands of homes across King County by co-sponsoring Health through Housing, home ownership initiatives, Tiny House villages, the Youth Achievement Center, and more. My office passed historic tenant protections to keep people in their homes in the wake of a global pandemic. My office created new gun violence prevention strategies to reduce the shootings in key areas around the district. These are just a fraction of our efforts but much more is needed. I am running for a second term on the King County Council to continue the work of keeping our communities safe, housed, and healthy.

As your Councilmember, I will focus on proven, commonsense solutions on crime, homelessness, and public health. As an immigrant child from the Philippines who grew up in south Seattle, I've seen firsthand our community’s biggest challenges. I was fortunate to have access to quality healthcare, thanks to my mom's union. Inspired by her, I chose nursing as my profession, serving a diverse community, including those experiencing homelessness and addiction. As Mayor, I take action to prevent and address drug deaths: the fastest rising numbers in the nation. On County Council, I will focus on housing and treatment services. I will push for increased accountability from our troubled Regional Homelessness Authority. Countywide, communities are struggling with crime. This is especially true for our most economically vulnerable neighborhoods. When people call 911, they deserve a fast, effective response. I am the only candidate in this race who has consistently opposed defunding the police. As Mayor, I worked to increase law enforcement staffing. On King County Council, I will deliver both commonsense reforms and more first responders. King County has a lot to be optimistic about.

As soon as I was sworn in for my term in January of 2020, this was put to the test. COVID-19 was a once-in-a-generation pandemic that truly shook the foundations of our society. We saw chaos in supply chain logistics and travel through the airport came to a screeching halt.  I’m proud that despite COVID-19, the port weathered the pandemic without laying off a single port employee and saved every small and minority dining and retail tenant at the airport from going out of business. We were able to do this because we made principled decisions that put people first. Despite the pandemic, we were able to invest in the airport to get upgraded from 3 to 4-stars by Skytrax and we won “Best Airport in North America” in 2022 and 2023. We were also the only port on the west coast to add container terminal space during the pandemic. I have worked tirelessly to ensure the growth and economic prosperity of King County, promote sustainability, and combat human trafficking. I’m asking for 4 more years because the job’s not finished. In a post-pandemic world, we must build the “port of the future.” A future where we create the next generation of strong family wage jobs; A future where we are the greenest port in North America; A future where we usher in new technologies such as hydrogen and offshore wind. With your support, we can build a port of the future that we can all be proud of.  Endorsed by over 50 local elected leaders, Seattle Building Trades, ILWU, Washington Conservation Action, King County Democrats and many others.",

            "statement": "It’s been an honor to serve King County residents for the past 7.5 years on the Seattle Port Commission. I’m running for a third term to continue my environmental leadership advancing a just and inclusive transition to a clean energy economy that generates living wage careers.          My public service is guided by a triple bottom line: commerce, community, and climate.  I’m committed to expanding environmental and economic justice, especially for near-port communities and small, minority owned businesses.  My experience is needed to exercise policy direction over a fast-growing airport, homeport for Alaska cruise ships and fishing fleet, marinas, parks, and marine cargo Alliance with the Port of Tacoma.         The Port generates 121,000 jobs.  The airport and seaport have won customer service awards even during major construction.  But Port activities also impact communities and the climate. That’s why I’m leading initiatives to electrify seaport and airport operations and transition to alternative fuels for trucks, ships, and planes.  I’m also working to protect parks, advance bicycle safety and Duwamish River cleanup.         I’ll continue reducing the Port’s carbon footprint by directing significant state and federal funding for clean energy projects; Inspiring youth to pursue Port-related careers through apprenticeships and internships; and expanding partnerships with Tribes and the Seattle Aquarium for projects from kelp to killer whales and ecotourism. With your support, I’ll continue to champion Port policies rooted in fiscal responsibility, ecological integrity, and social equity.  I respectfully ask for your vote.         Endorsed By: Seattle Times, The Stranger, MLK Labor Council, Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell, Governor Inslee, Attorney General Ferguson, King County Executive Constantine, County Councilmembers Balducci, Zahilay, Upthegrove, McDermott, Kohl-Welles, Dembowski, Seattle Port Commissioners Mohamed, Hasegawa and Cho, Senators Saldana and Keiser, Sierra Club, King County Democrats and Republicans, Puget Sound Pilots, Pacific Maritime Shipping Association, Planned Parenthood.",

Since 1911, it has promoted economic opportunities and quality of life by advancing trade, commerce, travel, and job creation in an accountable and responsible manner. As a resident of King County for four decades, I’ve experienced the port’s impacts. The port has failed us; environmental issues are hurting low-income communities in South County and it’s time to set a new course with integrity.   We have shared goals: A thriving economy, a cleaner environment, increased family-wage jobs, and a fair and equitable society. We must stop the path of mismanagement. With my extensive career in banking, finance, and real estate, I am ready to steer the port in the right direction as a steward of your hard-earned money.  As an immigrant who arrived with $300, I’ve worked my way up from the mailroom to the boardroom, I’ve founded two Washington state community banks to create jobs for small, women- and minority-owned businesses. I am a staunch promoter of fiscal responsibility with accountability, working closely with stakeholders, labor unions, industry, and trade partners to regain trust in our port. I will promote transitioning from fossil fuels to sustainable green energy.   If elected, I will bring engaging management and open financial positions with transparency to our port community. This will enable us to focus on our dual mission: Generating family-wage jobs and safeguarding our environment. Vote for a stronger, cleaner, and trusted Seattle Port.   Endorsements: ATU Local 587, former WA State Governor Gary Locke, King County Assessor John Wilson, Bellevue Mayor Lynne Robinson, Sen.

Access will be limited to those within walking distance of Bellevue T/C and East Main station. Riders will be required to transfer from light rail to and from buses at the South Bellevue P&R for the commute into and out of Seattle. In 2025 ST’s East Link debut will end ST550 and force all I-90 bus riders transfer to light rail on Mercer Island for the commute into and out of Seattle. It’s the “eastside” version of the ST plan to use “voter approved” extensions to replace buses into Seattle; reducing transit capacity into the city and nothing to reduce congestion. ST will use eastside taxes to help fund a 2nd tunnel rather than use the existing DSTT for those wanting to go beyond CID. The tunnel ends easy access to SeaTac and beyond, spending more than $12B and 6-10 years disrupting Seattle. Part of the reason why the $54B ST3 funding voters approved in 2016 has grown to $160B and continues to grow.",

Instead, we increased the number of officers. Rather than going along with the crime-tolerant attitude of the state and county, we acted to discourage the public use of drugs, sleeping on sidewalks, and stealing shopping carts. We continually work on cleaning up and discouraging homeless encampments. At the same time, we refer those impacted by addiction and mental illness to appropriate services. The soon-to-open light rail brings challenges and opportunities to Federal Way. I am actively working to encourage businesses and healthy market-rate housing to locate here. We are turning the ship, but still have far to go. I look forward to continuing to serve you as together we help Federal Way be a wonderful place to work, live, raise families and retire. I appreciate your vote.",

As Kirkland’s Legislative Chair, I advocated for mental health investments, housing solutions, and funding for the Kirkland Performance Center and CKC. I will continue to listen, lead, and deliver. I ask for your vote.

I know the importance of maintaining essential services for all homes, families, and businesses.

As a dedicated employee and mom, I wanted Amazon to do better, and wanted to show my kids the importance of doing what’s right. I put my career on the line and led thousands of my coworkers to take an unprecedented stand. I outlined a plan to win, did the work, and delivered results. Our actions led to Amazon’s Climate Pledge, Bezos’s $10 billion Earth Fund, and increased worker safety. Now I want to help Seattle rise to the challenges of our times. We must make rapid and meaningful progress on safety, homelessness, affordability, and climate change. There are more unsheltered people on our streets than ever. Immediately, we need to increase stable permanent housing and coordinate with regional partners to ensure that those experiencing homelessness have paths to necessary resources. We need to feel safe in our neighborhoods and parks. We can have police and alternative responses; lead with compassion and refuse to tolerate harmful behavior; and tackle poverty, mental illness, and addiction so that crime decreases. I will be a strong advocate for bringing response times down, while ending racial bias and excessive force. Climate change is here and our city isn’t ready. With new federal funding, I will help lead our city to reduce emissions and protect residents from heatwaves, smoke, and flooding. My vision for Seattle is to establish holistic public safety, end homelessness, and lead the nation into the new green economy. Together we can build a safe, equitable, sustainable city for all.

A severe lack of housing for people at all income levels means that those at the bottom are suffering the most. We must build more affordable housing, particularly low-income housing and workforce housing for middle income residents. As a former foster kid, I know what it’s like to be completely uprooted and swept away. We must do better for our unhoused neighbors. Sadly, the homelessness crisis in our city has devolved into a total humanitarian catastrophe. It is our moral imperative to take urgent action and find people housing and treatment now.  At City Hall, I’ll normalize collaborating across differences, finding common ground, and getting bold things accomplished that work for everyone. I know there is a better way forward for Seattle, and I couldn’t be more energized at the opportunity we have to do it together!  Endorsed by The Seattle Times, 34th District Democrats, King County Councilmember Girmay Zahilay, State Representative Chipalo Street, former 34th Rep.

I’ve got the experience to organize community-centered approaches and I secure the investments to match. I deliver on progressive values rather than simply profess them. My office has a proven track record of taking action. I committed to investing in historically under-funded schools, so I funded mental health and leadership programs in Southend schools. I said I would prevent displacement, so we won tenant protections, monumental worker protections—like paid sick leave for gig workers—and rent control for small businesses. I secured permanent funding for community-driven development, and for the Green New Deal. I envision housing abundance, affordability, and vibrant small businesses within reach of all generations who stay rooted in their community. Children with full stomachs and single mothers with full wallets. Community networks preventing violence rather than only reacting to it. I’ve only just begun building alternatives to punishment and incarceration—especially for our Black and brown neighbors, who suffer from the paradox of over-policing and under-policing. We all deserve to feel safe in our neighborhoods. As a mom with two kids in Seattle Public Schools, it’s important that all our children feel safe, protected, and cared for. We’ve only begun that work by investing in the resources District 2 needs to improve our community health, joy, and safety. Thank you for electing me to serve D2’s vibrant communities. I hope to earn your vote for re-election. Proudly endorsed by The Stranger, MLK Labor, King County Dems, Progreso Latino, Rep.

I want to change that. As a community advocate and proven leader I have fought against continued discrimination from the city towards one of the most endangered neighborhoods in America, and I’ve seen that fighting for our voice and community based solutions is a fight we can win. I'll bring that same passion to fight for all of south Seattle. We can have better public safety. Every week, my watch group works side by side with community and unhoused neighbors providing mutual aid and helping connect people to essential services. I have administered Narcan, CPR and fought for our most vulnerable, marginalized communities. We need a balanced approach that invests in community programs and works in collaboration with city agencies.  We can have more affordable housing while fighting displacement and gentrification. My family renovated the historic Louisa Hotel into workforce housing which only charges residents a percentage of their income so nobody is charged rent they cannot afford. I have the experience to build more homes and social housing.  Our community is tired of elected officials always responding with words and good intentions that yield no results. Things aren’t getting better, it’s time for a change. We need leaders who are not afraid of the streets of South Seattle, who will be there for our community when it’s hard, to listen and make a real difference.

I’ve already created positive changes in housing and transit, reforming enforcement and improving neighborhoods. I led First Hill’s neighborhood association, where we welcomed affordable housing, safer transportation, improved parks, and increased livability.

PubliCola added, “Hudson is the most qualified candidate for any of this year’s open seats, blowing the rest of the field away…” I offer substantive, constructive solutions to complicated problems like homelessness, public safety, and affordability. We can build more housing, care for vulnerable neighbors, and keep everyone safe. I understand how to make progress on our challenges.

Instead, I’ve got a serious plan to build the ambitious future we deserve. I didn’t start life in a place like Roosevelt. I’m the product of a teen pregnancy, but my parents managed to buy a house and build us a beautiful life. I got really lucky, graduated from Harvard Law School, launched a tech company, and have been a business leader since. Journeys like mine are impossible in Seattle today. Seattle should be a place where people from any background can afford to raise a family, build a career, and age comfortably–and where no one lives on the street. Where it is as easy to get around without a car as it is with one, and where tomorrow’s workforce has housing and childcare they can afford in tree-lined neighborhoods they love. This means we have to fix our finances–from tens of millions in waste, to using revenue sources that don’t take from young families or seniors on fixed incomes. We can’t let the big-money PACs trying to buy this election cut their taxes and keep leaving the rest of us with the tab.  As a parent, I will always put results ahead of political theatrics when it comes to safety. Let’s stop crime before it starts with evidence-based prevention, quickly send the right professional for each emergency, and rebuild trust in law enforcement through good governance and accountability. I’m proud to be endorsed by the MLK labor council, the local Democrats, the Sierra Club, and political leaders like Darya Farivar, Nicole Macri, Hilary Franz, Toshiko Haswegawa, Ryan Calkins, Sam Cho, Teresa Mosqueda, Girmay Zahilay, and many more.

Five-minute response times for priority 911 calls, get guns off our streets, shut down open-air drug markets, help neighborhood small businesses recover, address addiction and the mental health crisis. It’s also unacceptable that three years after the murder of George Floyd, Seattle still has no alternative to armed response to 911 calls. Not all situations require uniformed police officers, but some do. I’ll prioritize making this happen. I will also bring people together to build more affordable housing and address the homelessness crisis.   My parents moved from Puerto Rico to the Bronx in search of a better life. My dad was a welder and proud union member, and my mom worked at a factory.

I work at my district office and hold weekly office hours to hear from you directly. Public Safety: Yes, “defund the police” was a mistake. I’ve supported fully funding the police staffing and hiring plans every year, created a public safety coordinator in Ballard, increased Harbor Patrol, and funded Mobile Crisis teams. I’ll continue fully funding the police and working to make policing better and safer. Homelessness: I resolved the Woodland Park and Ballard Commons encampments without sweeps, expanded outreach teams working with people living in cars, and created neighborhood-based homelessness response teams. We need to expand our efforts to get homeless people into housing, build and buy permanent housing, and push regional partners to act faster. Housing: I cut red tape to build housing faster and launched audits on our permitting process. I reduced eviction threats for tenants while ensuring landlords are made whole. We must increase the stock of family-size units so people of all income levels can afford it here. Raised in District 6, I’m committed to our community’s success. I want to raise my kids in a neighborhood that is safer than the one I grew up in. I’ve dedicated my life to public service, serving with AmeriCorps and working to combat gun violence.

I understand the critical ground-level needs in our neighborhoods. I’ll take bold steps to improve Seattle. Simply put, Seattle deserves better leadership.My priorities are clear:Community Safety: The incumbent City Council needs to be held accountable for their vocal support to defund the police. We need a council that makes responsible decisions, even in difficult situations. I’ll focus on restoring police staffing levels, and I’ll push for alternative first responders for situations that don’t require armed interventions. Housing & Homelessness: The homelessness crisis demands swift and effective action. Our incumbent City Council has failed to act on this urgent issue. Short-term, we need to increase shelter availability, establish additional tiny home villages, and improve mental health and drug treatment services. In the long run, we must expand housing options and expedite the permitting process. We need to act urgently to provide much-needed support for our most vulnerable citizens. Our current city council can’t be trusted to make the tough decisions necessary to keep us moving forward. I’m running because we need a more pragmatic, problem-solving approach to shape Seattle’s shared future. Endorsed: Seattle Times and hundreds of your neighbors who want change. I’m Pete Hanning, and I ask for your vote.",

In my first term, I brought together unlikely coalitions to deliver results and I’ll continue that work if re-elected.Public Safety: In my first term, I increased our park ranger program from two to 28 rangers, fully funded the police hiring budget each year, passed an ordinance protecting firefighters from harassment in the line of duty, and worked with Mayor Harrell to create a civilian behavioral health response in lieu of police involvement. If re-elected, I’ll increase these alternative responses, continue the shared commitment of the Council and Mayor to recruit and retain police, and support community programs proven to reduce repeated criminal behavior and interrupt gun violence.Housing And Homelessness: We need to get people out of encampments and into stable housing immediately. Working with Mayor Harrell, my office helped create the Unified Care Team, a one-stop, no-excuses shop to navigate people experiencing homelessness into shelter and resolve encampments. Encampments have been reduced by 42%, but much work remains. Over the next four years, I’ll increase enhanced shelter options like tiny houses so people experiencing homelessness have a stable shelter, rather than being displaced to another encampment. I’ll also work with city partners to build and acquire social and non-profit housing so more people can afford to live in our community.Climate Change: We are running out of time to combat climate change. Seattle must confront the emergency with housing planning that emphasizes dense, walkable communities, electrification of buildings, and safe, reliable public transportation.Rated strongly aligned by the Downtown Seattle Association.Endorsements: MLK Labor, 36th and 43rd Democrats, Alliance for Gun Responsibility Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, Attorney General Bob Ferguson, Executive Dow Constantine",

I’ll help lead our city to meet the challenges we face on public safety, public health, and homelessness. Seattle can feel like a thriving, vibrant community again. I’m a first-generation American, civic leader, and stay-at-home dad supporting my wife’s work as a Civil Rights Attorney – including the landmark case with the ACLU overturning “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” I volunteer with several neighborhood-level public safety and community organizations, including as former Chair of the Queen Anne Community Council’s Public Safety Committee. We need to get serious about crime reduction. The Council’s pledge to defund SPD by 50% was irresponsible and undercut our public safety and our ability to implement reform. I support allocating additional resources to recruitment, retention, training, and community policing – including non-police responders – to prevent crime and decrease response times. We cannot solve our public safety issues without addressing public health. The City Council has enabled open drug use and dealing in our neighborhoods including Downtown, which claimed the lives of 500+ Seattleites last year and is contributing to violent crime. We must add mental health hospital bed capacity and addiction treatment centers, but we also need principled leadership to build partnerships and demand accountability. I’ll prioritize programs and service providers that prove they work. With increasing shelter space, it’s time to restore our public spaces and stop relying on unsafe, inhumane encampments. I’ll partner with the Mayor and focus Seattle government on saving lives, keeping the vulnerable safe, and restoring our beautiful city.  I’m a pragmatic progressive who believes that ground-level results are more important than political platitudes.

My own passion for education has its roots in my grandmother's limited opportunities in segregated schools during the Jim Crow era. She knew she wanted better for my father, and then for me. Her relentless drive and sacrifices enabled us to attend excellent schools on the East Coast. Since moving into LWSD with my own family 10 years ago, I’ve witnessed the high-quality education offered in public schools here. I’ve also been frustrated by unnecessary hurdles that prevent students from reaching their full potential. Today, these hurdles are often invisible, but they are every bit as real as the ones my grandmother faced. In my career as a program manager at Microsoft, I’ve learned the importance of actively seeking feedback from various stakeholders and prioritizing resources to drive towards impactful solutions. As an LWSD board director, I will use the skills and experiences I’ve developed at Microsoft and as a parent to make our schools more effective, equitable, and inclusive for all students. I believe that together, we can make LWSD schools better for everyone.

After the Ingraham High shooting I worked directly with students, parents, and staff to review district policies and champion gun violence prevention. I’ve led inclusive education policy changes in Instructional Philosophy and Special Education. As the Board’s Legislative Liaison, I helped secure additional state resources for special education (WA State is now finally in federal compliance!), as well as access to career and technical education, and needed behavioral health support for students. I led efforts to ban isolation and limit restraint in SPS– practices that disproportionately impact students of color and with disabilities. Our policy is now a state model for preventative and restorative practices.  Together, we can meet the needs of our diverse learners and make our public schools the top choice for education for Seattle’s families. I’m committed to navigating budget and enrollment challenges with transparency, clarity, and community partnership– to maximize student benefit while operating within our means.

School closures have deep and lasting impacts on communities and should be an absolute last resort after exhausting all other options to balance the budget. The inequities in academic achievement need urgent attention and focus to make Seattle Public Schools the exemplary learning environment students deserve. My priorities as a School Board Director will be: Calling for a district-wide audit to ensure dollars are spent with fiscal accountability; ensuring students can thrive and feel safe while gaining a high-quality education, no matter their identity; implementing a stronger community engagement process, especially when big district decisions are made, that centers communities furthest from educational opportunities; bringing transparency back in the budget and policy development processes. Representation matters.

Together we can create understanding and process to address key issues impacting enrollment and funding. We must stop making excuses and get to the heart of why families are leaving SPS. Providing for our students’ academic and basic needs, including child care, transportation, and specialized services is the right thing to do and will increase enrollment in our schools. Safety concerns must be met with action. Buildings need updating. Care for our communities must be present in the district's response to incidents and emergencies. Students need equitable access to social and emotional care, anti-racist environments, and culturally responsive academic supports. I’m not a politician, I’m an educator.

I am running for re-election because I'm committed to ensuring Seattle Public Schools makes good on its promises of providing students a safe, inclusive and high-quality educational experience. As the mom of two SPS graduates and one in 2nd grade, I know firsthand the challenges students and educators face in our district. While visiting and volunteering in schools, I have seen the importance of not just attracting qualified teachers, but of retaining them, by giving them the support they need to help students thrive. Every student has unique needs, and that is why I am committed to advocating for increased school funding, strengthening our partnerships with families and community organizations, and codifying every students’ right to have a voice in the decisions that affect them.   Seattle Public Schools is facing a budget deficit over the next few years, and I want to continue to work with you, and our entire SPS community, to ensure that public input is actively sought out and utilized, in advance of looming tough decisions. As a woman of color, who grew up poor and faced housing insecurity, I believe that every voice should be heard, especially those of our LGBTQ+, Black, Indigenous, families of color, and those who have historically been underrepresented due to obstacles in participating in our public systems. I would be honored to have your vote. Endorsements: King County Democrats; 36th District Democrats; 32nd District Democrats; Alliance for Gun Responsibility Victory Fund; State Senator Javier Valdez; Seattle School Board Director Vivian Song Maritz; Shoreline School Board Director Rebeca Rivera; Edmonds School Board Director Carin Chase; Education and Economic Justice Advocate Summer Stinson; The Stranger; and others.

Essential to the project of systemic change is a commitment to centering families furthest from educational justice. As the parent of three SPS students, one of my core beliefs is that we advocate most effectively for our own children when we advocate for all children. I’m running for school board because I believe every child in this city is entitled to a high quality education- defined by rigor, relevance and relationships- no matter what neighborhood they live in.  In order to effectively address disparities in our schools we must align our district to focus on student outcomes, so that every child in this city receives the education they deserve. A system that is responsive to the needs of kids is, by definition, an equitable system. My top priorities include: 1) addressing the youth mental health crisis by increasing the number of trained mental health professionals in buildings, promoting mental health awareness and destigmatization, and using our schools as hubs to connect students and their families to wrap around services, 2) fostering transparency and responsible financial management through increased community engagement, seeking input from parents, educators, and community members to ensure that our financial decisions align with the needs and priorities of our diverse community, and 3) expanding equitable access to advanced learning opportunities for all students. I chose a career in filmmaking because I believe stories shape how we see and understand the world.

I’m running for School Board because I believe that we can meet this challenge and build great schools for all families.  I’ve called Seattle home for 20 years– fighting for housing affordability as the Executive Director of the Washington Low Income Housing Alliance, and working at leading technology companies. I’m a proud SPS parent. I have been endorsed by the Seattle Times, the 32nd Legislative District Democrats, former Seattle School Board members, and SPS parents looking for change.  We need systemic change to address urgent needs. After a student died from gun violence at Ingraham High School there was little to no response. The Board and District intend to close neighborhood schools and have ended vital enrichment programs. Students furthest from educational justice are, using the District’s own measures, worse off than they were in 2019. Budget concerns are a result of a fundamentally unsound financial footing. As a result, many parents who can are leaving for private schools. We deserve a School Board that takes gun violence seriously. We deserve a Board that fights to keep neighborhood schools open and offer programs that draw students in. We deserve a Board that does more than talk about improving outcomes for kids most in need of help, but insists on results. I don’t have all the answers, but I believe that bringing in new voices is the first step to getting back on the right track.  In their endorsement, the Seattle Times noted my “willingness to speak truth to power and dive into the details.”  With your vote I’ll be a strong, unwavering voice for accountability, results, and more importantly- our kids.",

Now, as I prepare to send my daughter into the same underfunded system, like many other parents, I’m worried. Seattle Public Schools faces a staggering $104.4 million budget shortfall for the 2024-2025 school year.

It’s clear we need experienced leaders prepared to tackle these issues with innovative solutions and an unwavering commitment to our kids. I am well equipped to help bring stability and transformation to our schools, restoring parental and community confidence. As chief legal counsel and policy advisor to the King County Executive, I managed complex policy and budget challenges - prioritizing equity, accountability, and delivery of services. With your vote, my priorities will be: 1) Ensuring equity in education for all students, regardless of their background, so that every child has the opportunity to succeed; 2) Cultivating safe, inclusive, and welcoming environments, where every student feels valued and respected; 3) Empowering educators through comprehensive support and fostering professional growth, recognizing their critical role in shaping our children's future; 4) Engaging parents and communities to create a collaborative educational system that restores confidence in the governance of our district, and reflects the diverse needs and perspectives of our city. Together, I believe we can create a Seattle Public Schools system where parents and students look forward to the start of each school day. Endorsed by: The Seattle Times & The Stranger; Seattle Education Association; Alliance for Gun Responsibility; King County and 34th LD Democrats, Metropolitan Democratic Club; Women’s Political Caucus; One America Votes; Seattle Student Union; County Executive Dow Constantine, Legislative Democrats, current and former School Board leaders, more!",

Parents, students, and teachers need to be better informed and consulted about education demands and budget priorities. \"Maryanne Wood's impassioned candidacy, spurred by her opposition to what she calls the \"mega school\"  plan, should serve as a barometer of community sentiment...It is also a reflection of anger across the district at a marked  lack of transparency around the current school board's decision-making.\"  - The Seattle Times Editorial Board. SPS's decision making process lacks transparency. Elect me to the School Board and I will work tirelessly to change that. Seattle Public Schools faces declining enrollments, budget deficits, elimination of resources and programs, possible closures, consolidation, teacher and staff layoffs according to an article published by the Seattle Times in April of 2023.  SPS is facing an estimated $131 million deficit for 2023-24 and $92 million for 2024-25 yet they are still planning to construct large, one-size-fits-all buildings to replace aging school. I live by the one planned for Alki Elementarty. A consolidation is a closure.These new schools provide no parking for staff or parents. ADA parking is insufficient.The Alki school rebuild and remodel is an example of this.  I will work to make sure these projects are scaled back if they don't have full community support. ADA parking and transportation needs must be given priority because if you can't get your child safely to the school, they can't be educated. As a grassroots candidate I would appreciate your vote,Endorsed by Vicki Schmitz, whose family donated the land for Schmitz Park Elementary and Scott Pinkham ( first Native American to serve on the SPS Board )",

I made the decision to join the school bard because I believe education is the most powerful tool we can offer to our children and youth to thrive as adults   Being in the school board is the most effective way to help children. The role of the school board is to work closely with the community to ensure all students have what is needed emotionally and academically. Ensuring the mission and the vision of the school is met by developing policy, curriculum and managing budget.",

As a teacher at Vashon Island High School for thirty-three years, I have seen educational trends come and go, but the core mission to provide high-quality education for all students remains the same. A perennial challenge is funding, mostly due to how our state allocates money. As the former negotiator for the Vashon Education Association, I am well acquainted with this issue. It is the Board’s duty to be fiscally responsible. This requires careful consideration, intense listening, and to gather information from the people affected by the School Board’s decisions. I recognize that our District faces new challenges due to economic, technological, and social change. I strive to be open minded, without a preconceived agenda, to work hard, and do my best. Endorsed by: Vashon Education Association Council, National Women's Political Caucus",

Misplaced priorities, secrecy, and risk aversion at the expense of our children’s safety and education has fostered a deep mistrust of our institution.  I have experience and leadership skills required to effectuate tangible improvements. Change is needed when inequities, policy violations, or impactful budgetary constraints arise. I can make difficult decisions and recognize when challenging the status quo is needed.    I’m an experienced manager, labor relations professional, public servant, and mother of two children in the district who is willing to be accountable and transparent in my actions, to represent the interests of, and commitment to, educators, students, and families.",

Multiple, ongoing instances of student sexual predation by adults who were charged with their education and care require a deep consideration of our collective responsibility and a forensic examination of how this was allowed to go on for so long. New leaders must steward a process of repair and reflection with bold and ambitious vision. I commit to center the students furthest from educational justice, including students of color, English language learners, members of the LGBTQIA+ community, and neurodivergent learners. Doing so will improve the outcomes and day-to-day experiences of all VISD students. As a longtime community organizer, my volunteer and board experience includes the Vashon Food Bank, VIGA’s Food Access Partnership, and the Vashon Green School.",
